Although the incidence of Bell's palsy in the general population is low (15-30 cases per 100 000 person-years), Bell's palsy following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has attracted attention. In line with clinical trial data that suggested a substantial but non-significant risk of Bell's palsy following exposure to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (rate ratio 7 0, p=0 07), a case series and nested case-control study reported a non-significantly increased risk of Bell's palsy following BNT162b2 vaccination. Although a number of limitations have been considered, Eric Yuk Fai Wan and colleagues might have overlooked possible selection bias, which was partly due to their method of selecting study participants and partly due to substantially different COVID-19 vaccination rates between different age groups (appendix).
