This perspective article aims to present insights into an initiative to provide free psychological support to students at the University of Gdansk (UG) - one of the first universities in Poland to offer such help - during the first major COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in March 2020. We conclude by reflecting on the challenges for mental health posed by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the outcome of our initiative - the creation of the Academic Psychological Support Centre at the University of Gdansk. According to PMT, one crucial aspect of dealing with the consequences of the pandemic is maintaining one's connection to oneself.
