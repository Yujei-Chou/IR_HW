The speed and accuracy of phenotype detection from medical images are some of the most important qualities needed for any informed and timely response such as early detection of cancer or detection of desirable phenotypes for animal breeding. Both raw vs. ground truth and raw vs. predicted showed the lowest image similarity values with an average MSE of 58,674 +- 17,766 and 58,008 +- 17,319 and with average SSIs of 0.49 +- 0.025 and 0.48 +- 0.024, respectively, indicating a high degree of image dissimilarity. This hypothesis was later confirmed by re-introducing artificial random movement (such as rotation or vertical/horizontal shifts) into the images used for GAN training, resulting in a higher validation loss, poorer network performance and blurry resultant images (Supplementary Figures S1-S9).Unfortunately, using this limited dataset resulted in one of the unseen images containing a small amount of testis tissue following processing with the GAN which was then incorrectly quantified as fat tissue.
