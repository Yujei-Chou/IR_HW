SARS-CoV-2 replication requires the synthesis of a set of structural proteins expressed through discontinuous transcription of ten subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs). These results demonstrate that our ddPCR assays are accurate and have high sensitivity in detecting ORF1ab RNA and N and S sgmRNAs.ddPCR assays for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gRNA and of the N and S sgmRNAs were applied to 166 RNA samples obtained from naso-pharyngeal swabs of SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects (Supplementary Data 7). 3, highly significant levels of correlation were observed when expression levels, as estimated by analysis of NGS meta-transcriptomic data, were compared with copy number estimates obtained by ddPCR, for all the three target genes (ORF1ab, Fig.
