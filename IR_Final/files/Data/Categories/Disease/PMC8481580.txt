Literature about the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently focusing on the potential cognitive and neuropsychiatric sequelae observed in individuals receiving intensive care unit (ICU) treatments. Accordingly, other studies also highlighted the presence of cognitive difficulties mainly in working memory, divided attention, and processing speed. Results also showed that PCL scores are instead predicted by the intensity of care received by being intubated during hospitalization and by the persistence of cough 1 month after hospitalization (see Table 2), while the presence of neurologic symptoms [beta = 0.11 (1.68), p = 0.09] or of other alterations due to COVID-19 infection (i.e., muscular alterations, hair loss, concentration difficulty, insomnia, headache, gastrointestinal disorders, and cough) did not have any significant predictive role.
