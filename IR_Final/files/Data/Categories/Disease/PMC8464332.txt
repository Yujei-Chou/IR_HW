Dear editor
We would like to thank the readership of the journal for their comments pertaining to our paper on "Changing Student Perception of an Online Integrated Structured Clinical Examination During the COVID-19 Pandemic". However, the change scores in Questions 5 and 6 in Table 2 specifically address the online nature of assessments and we had asked two versions of these questions - "If you do not do well" in Question 5 and "If you do well to" in Question 6 to parse the relevance of the examination outcome of students sitting these high stakes examinations if they were indeed conducted online. This key stake-holder data will be needed before general implementation of this format for summative clinical assessments.
