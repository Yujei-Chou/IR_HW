The financial market is a complex system in which the assets influence each other, causing, among other factors, price interactions and co-movement of returns. Consistency refers to ensuring that the machine successfully recovers the average orientation of the spins and the pairwise connection between assets. On the other hand, when considering only the U.S. market in the COVID-19 outbreak, we found that in times of low volatility, the ability of the pairwise model to explain information is lower than in times of high volatility.
