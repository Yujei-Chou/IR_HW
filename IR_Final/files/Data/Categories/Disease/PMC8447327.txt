Abstract
The unprecedented public health emergency crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected intensive care unit professionals revealing a high prevalence of psychological impact causing stress, depression and anxiety. In relation to the number of COVID patients under their care, significantly higher scores were found among health care workers who had to attend to more than 20 COVID patients in comparison to those who had fewer (See Table 1).Regarding gender, statistically significant differences (t = -4.922, P < .001, Cohen's d = .65) were found, with women presenting higher scores; it was found that 61.8% of the women presented symptoms consistent with a possible diagnosis of GAD (according to the cut-off point for a possible diagnosis) versus 41.2% of the men (chi-square = 10.161, P = .001). On the one hand, the prevalence of GAD symptoms confirms the psychological impact and the challenge that health care professionals faced during the pandemic.
