The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, is rapidly spreading and severely straining the capacities of public health communities and systems around the world. After optimizing the DMP-PVDF filter for pathogen enrichment and extraction, we evaluated its capacity to detect E. coli for DNA and the Brucella ovis for RNA ranging from 1 x 102 to 1 x 105 CFU/mL. The RT-qPCR CT value of the DNA and RNA extracted using the DMP-PVDF filter (light green) was earlier than those obtained using the spin column kit (gray), which extracted DNA and RNA without pathogen enrichment (Figure S1B,C). These results suggest that the DMP-PVDF platform can also be used with SARS-CoV-2 enrichment.
