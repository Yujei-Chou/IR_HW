Introduction
The incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in the Belgian community is currently estimated based on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid antigen test results of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-like symptoms and, to a lesser extent, of individuals with epidemiological arguments for testing. Based on the unweighted overall positivity ratio (black dots), the highest peak % SARS-CoV-2 carriership was observed during the first and second Belgian COVID-19 wave (i.e., 3.59% in April and 3.00% in November 2020).Regional differences in SARS-CoV-2 positivity ratio are also shown in Fig 1 with the highest percentages of positive tests observed in West Flanders (orange points) during the first COVID-19 wave and second COVID-19 wave. Some studies report no significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory samples received from different age groups.
