Background: To achieve herd immunity, the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine by the population, especially healthcare professionals, plays a key role. Similar results were found when conducting multinomial logistic regression models (Supplementary Table 3).The present study aimed to investigate the attitudes and intention to vaccinate in a sample of 2,136 adults in Spain. In a survey conducted in Israel, significant differences regarding the intention to vaccinate between physicians, nurses, and the general population were found.
