The immense impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health systems has motivated the scientific community to search for clinical prognostic factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we explored the potential association of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct value with the severity of the disease in the community by evaluating data of patients diagnosed at primary health care centers (PHCs).All NPS for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing received from the PHCs in the catchment area of our hospital from June 2020 to January 2021 were included in the analysis. The following variables were associated with death in the univariate analysis: the cycle threshold for the N gene (OR: 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.96, p = 0.02) and the patient's age (OR: 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.25, p = 0.008).
