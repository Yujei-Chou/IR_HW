Thromboembolic events are frequently reported in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, PLTs  contents of calcium and cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate (cAMP) were identified to play central role in antibody-induced procoagulant PLT formation. Our data indicate that upregulation of cAMP could be a potential therapeutic target to prevent antibody-mediated coagulopathy in COVID-19 disease.
