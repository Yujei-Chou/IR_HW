The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on patients undergoing radiotherapy by comparing the patterns of unplanned radiotherapy interruption before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. To determine the differences in radiotherapy interruption before and after the screening clinic was established, we included a comparison group of patients with breast cancer who received their first dose of radiotherapy between January 28, 2019 and July 31, 2019. None of the patients with screening clinic-related interruptions were actually confirmed to have COVID-19.
