Introduction
In December 2019, a set of pneumonia cases, which were later proven to be caused by a new coronavirus (named "COVID-19"), appeared in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.In contrast to adult data, children present asymptomatic infection in 13% of virologically confirmed cases, and only 0.6% progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ dysfunction. This study points the EIT ability to explore air distribution, to determine the center of ventilation, to analyze the inhomogeneity index of air distribution and estimate the tidal volume and FRC, aspects that are considered highly significant to the researchers using this technology, some of them presented at our data on COVID-19 children. The presented data demonstrate the pulmonary ventilation distribution in six pediatric patients with COVID-19 detected by EIT.
