Implementation efforts to increase adoption of health technologies (e.g., telehealth, mobile health, electronic health records, patient portals) have commonly focused on increasing the adoption of specific health technologies in specific service lines. Strategies were selected based on their perceived ability to decrease barriers and increase the adoption of health technologies in a large healthcare system. In-person visits were completed for sites B and C, however, due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in-person site visits were put on hold for sites A and D. Five of the seventy-three strategies were only used at the national program level to support efforts at sites and across the VHA enterprise, including the following strategies: 1) access new funding, 2) alter incentive/allowance structures, 3) alter patient/consumer fees, 22) create or change credentialling and/or licensure standards, and 34) fund and contract for the clinical innovation.
