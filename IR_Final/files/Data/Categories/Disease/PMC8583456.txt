This study investigates travel behavior and psychosocial factors that influence it during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other studies found most relations between personality traits and reactions to COVID-19 to be of small magnitudes. Travel avoidance was predicted by high rates of fear of travel (beta = 0.65, t = 5.89, p < 0.001), whereas demographic variables, severity of contracting COVID-19 at the destination, risk of infection and transmitting SARS-CoV-2 upon returning from travel, and coping did not significantly predict higher levels of travel avoidance (p > 0.05).Cautious travel was predicted by fear of travel (beta = 0.21, t = 2.78, p = 0.007) along with high levels of self-efficacy(Self-efficacy is inversely scored, lower score indicating high self-efficacy.)
