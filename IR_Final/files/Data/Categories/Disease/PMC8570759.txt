Introduction
Structural inequities (i.e., sociocultural and political disadvantages created by unfair systems) in access to reproductive health care, including contraception, in the United States (US) predated the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings indicate that women were facing barriers to care because of COVID-19, both early and mid-COVID-19 pandemic, with about half of contraception users who sought care during the COVID-19 pandemic reporting at least one barrier to contraception. We find that this additional burden created challenges for a minority of women to access contraceptive care.
