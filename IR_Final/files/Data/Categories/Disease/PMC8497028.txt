Background
As of September, 2021, the number of reported cases of COVID-19 exceeds 225 million worldwide, with more than 4 6 million deaths. The very severe cluster had a greater proportion of people no longer working after hospitalisation with COVID-19 (50 0% versus 10 0% to 16 1% across the other clusters; p<0 0001), and the greater proportion of people who experienced a change in occupation due to health reasons after COVID-19 (60 0% versus 8 7% to 19 4% across the other clusters; p<0 0001; appendix 1 p 17).This is the largest study, across multiple UK centres, to comprehensively report on prospectively assessed outcomes to describe the holistic impact of COVID-19 on the medium-term health of survivors. Further analysis of the trajectory of recovery and linkage to primary and secondary health records within PHOSP-COVID will enable further discrimination.
