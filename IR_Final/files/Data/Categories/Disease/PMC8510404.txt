The dielectric spectra of complex biomolecules reflect the molecular heterogeneity of the proteins and are particularly important for the calculations of electrostatic (Coulomb) and electrodynamic (van der Waals) interactions in protein physics. The electronic structure, dielectric response, and the solvent accessible surface partial charge distribution of the RGD peptide has been studied already, while here we present improved accuracy calculations of the dielectric function of dry 1FUV as well as for the 1FUV solvated and salted models.1FUV has 11 AAs (ACDCRGDCFCG) of six different types: Gly (two), Cys (four), Phe (one), Asp (two), Arg (one), and Ala (one). Other information on the electronic structure and intra- and inter-atomic bonding of SD1can be found in Ref..The solvation effects in SD1 have been addressed by adding 300 vicinal water molecules, as illustrated in Figure 5e.
