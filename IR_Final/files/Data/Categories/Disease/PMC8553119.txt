As safe and effective vaccines become widely available, attaining herd immunity and limiting the spread of COVID-19 will depend on individuals choosing to vaccinate:and doing so quickly enough to outpace mutations. Using online surveys conducted across six Latin American countries in January 2021, we experimentally assess messages designed to counteract informational deficiencies and collective action problems that may drive hesitancy. The economic recovery motivation, which could be interpreted either in selfish or pro-social terms, increased willingness to get vaccinated by 0.022 probability points (95% CI: -0.003 to 0.046), but was not statistically significant at the 95% level using a two-tailed test and had little effect on the number of months that a respondent would get vaccinated (95% CI: -0.17 to 0.15).Across six major Latin American countries, we document moderate:albeit cross-nationally varying:levels of vaccine hesitancy.
