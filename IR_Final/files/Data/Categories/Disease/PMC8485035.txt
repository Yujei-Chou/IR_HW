Evidence suggests that pregnant women who test positive for COVID-19 may develop more severe illness than non-pregnant women and may be at greater risk for psychological distress. COVID-19-positive women had higher total scores on the EPDS compared with women who tested negative (B = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.14-1.13, P = 0.01) and compared with the group of women who were not tested for COVID-19 (B = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.26-1.21, P = 0.002), both after adjustment for covariates. Although analyses were adjusted for gestational age, women who reported testing positive for COVID-19, were assessed early in their pregnancies, and they indicated they experienced greater depressive symptoms, given the potential unknown outcomes associated with maternal illness and fetal outcomes.
