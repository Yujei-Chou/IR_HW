Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents a scientific and social crisis. A significant expansion of populations of CD14+CD16+ monocytes producing IL-6 was observed in the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 in ICU compared with those patients who did not require ICU hospitalization. Patients with COVID-19 present decreased haemoglobin concentration and pathologically increased concentrations of ferritin.
