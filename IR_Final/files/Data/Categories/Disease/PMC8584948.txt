In 2020, the Governments of many countries maintained different levels of confinement of the population due to the pandemic that produced the COVID-19. The explanatory variables considered were selected according to the previous bibliography and with the biopsychosocial model of psychiatry that considers in the etiology of any mental disorder: biological factors such as sex, age or previous psychiatric diagnosis; psychological and interpersonal factors such as the level of family conflict and socio-cultural factors such as the type of housing or the maintenance of social relationships. In view of the above considerations, we conclude than in order to establish a risk profile for behavioural difficulties among children and adolescents diagnosed as affected by internalizing or externalizing disorders, socio-demographic and clinical variables should be taken into account.
