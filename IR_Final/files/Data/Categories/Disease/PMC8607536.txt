Abstract
Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late December 2019, morbidity and mortality continue to increase worldwide, with more than 240 million cases have been reported, and over 4.9 million people lost their lives due to this highly contagious disease, and even with numerous reports of re-infection. had some concerns of bias in the domain of randomization due to a lack of information on allocation concealment; the trial by Horby et al. On the other hand, the meta-analysis of seven trials revealed a statistically significant reduction in the odds of hospital admission with the administration of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody among outpatients with COVID-19 relative to non-administration of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody; the estimated effect indicated reduction in hospital admission (Figure 3; pooled odds ratio = 0.29; 95% confidence interval 0.21-0.42), and with adequate evidence to refute the null hypothesis of 'no significant difference', at the current sample size.
