Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first recognised in December 2019, brought about a global pandemic of respiratory disease, presenting a huge international challenge for both healthcare services and the corresponding populations which they serve. Protective factors included having a postgraduate degree (P = 0.003) or PhD (P = 0.003), having had no prior psychiatric treatment (P < 0.001) and not adhering to protective measures (P = 0.049).The finding that non-adherence with protective measures appears to be associated with significantly reduced post-traumatic stress symptoms is consistent with those of another Greek study by Parlapani et al who reported that greater adherence with COVID-19 guidance was associated with greater levels of fear reported. This was demonstrated in a meta-analysis by Salari et al who reported a pooled prevalence estimates of 31.9% (95% CI 27.5-36.7) for anxiety (across 17 studies with a total sample size of 63 439), and 33.7% (95% CI 27.5-40.6) for depression (across 14 studies comprising a sample size of 44 531).
