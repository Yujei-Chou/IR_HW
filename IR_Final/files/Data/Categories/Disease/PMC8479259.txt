Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel syndrome of multisystemic inflammation affecting children. An anti-inflammatory treatment with steroids (prednisolone 2 mg/kg/d), high-dose immunoglobulins (2 g/kg), and aspirin (3 days with 50 mg/kg/d, then 5 mg/kg/d) was initiated, as well as a venous thromboembolic prophylaxis with enoxaparin (antifactor Xa level 0.2-0.47) : due to the presumed hypercoagulable state with elevated D-dimers (maximum 7.34 mg/l) associated with MIS-C. Under this therapy the arterial hypotension and laboratory parameters continuously improved with the exception of a transient thrombocytopenia (minimum 33/nl). In a first posterior procedure, a multilevel laminoplasty failed to achieve a sufficient decompression: the hematoma appeared organized and firmly adherent to the anterior aspect of the cervical spinal cord (Fig.
