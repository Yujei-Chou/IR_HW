This review analyzes the published literature linking the different mechanisms focused on oxidative stress and inflammation that contribute to COVID-19 disease severity. Both Nox2 and MPO are implicated in NET formation in plasma isolated from patients with autoimmune conditions. Given the overlapping oxidative and proinflammatory and immunosuppressive mechanisms in cancer and COVID-19, promising drugs discovered from decades of clinical cancer research that are already in clinical trials or in consideration for clinical trials (e.g., Nrf2 activators, NF-kappaB inhibitors, iron chelators, classic antioxidants inhibiting NET formation, specific inhibitors of proinflammatory cytokines, mitochondria-targeted AMPK activators) may provide new insights into mitigating inflammation in survivors of COVID-19.B.
