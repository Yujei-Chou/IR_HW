This cohort study examines rates of cervical cancer screening in Puerto Rico among women with Medicaid health coverage following the 2017 hurricanes, earthquakes in late 2019-2020, and the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. Screening rates were particularly low after the hurricanes (September 2017: 1.02 per 100 person-months) and after the COVID-19-related lockdown (April 2020: 0.37 per 100 person-months) (Figure).Screening rates among women aged 21 to 29 years dropped from 2.90 per 100 person-months (95% CI, 2.83-2.97) in January to March 2016 to 1.00 (95% CI, 0.95-1.02) during April to June 2020 (Table). Urgent efforts are needed to recover plummeted cervical cancer screening rates and curb the rising cervical cancer burden in PR.
