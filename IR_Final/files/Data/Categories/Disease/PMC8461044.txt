Dental care professionals (DCPs) are thought to be at enhanced risk of occupational exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The discordance between seropositivity defined by the detection of the total antibody response (IgGAM) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, compared to the IgG isotype, arises from the optimization of the IgGAM assay for sensitivity in seroepidemiological studies (see Methods).In total, 74.1% (n = 1,116/1,507) of the cohort returned questionnaires regarding SARS-CoV-2 infections at 6 mo, and 62.6% (n = 944/1,507) were rebled. Thus, to determine an absolute level of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies associated with ongoing seropositivity at 6 mo, we reviewed the baseline antispike glycoprotein IgG levels of the 75 participants who were IgG positive at baseline that had been resampled prior to vaccination at 6 mo (Fig.
