Rapid, high-throughput diagnostic tests are essential to decelerate the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Upon including data from all measurement days, the forward selection approach resulted in a sensitivity of 87.4% for SARS-CoV-2, 87.4% for hCoV-NL63, and 89.4% for IAV-H1N1 (see Supplementary Table S7). Minor modifications of the instrument allowed continued alternating gas analysis of the headspace of the two test flasks connected to it.
