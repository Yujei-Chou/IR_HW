Clinical and surveillance testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus relies overwhelmingly on RT-qPCR-based diagnostics, yet several popular assays require 2-3 separate reactions or rely on detection of a single viral target, which adds significant time, cost, and risk of false-negative results. Validation of the LuNER assay was originally performed using contrived or clinical nasal-swab samples extracted and tested individually using a Ct cutoff of 40. When LuNER was first tested by the pop-up lab on the QuantStudio-3, the PCR efficiencies of N1 and E-Sarbeco were high in the complete master mix (104.7% and 99.6% respectively, Fig 5A).As the QuantStudio-3 does not have the ability to measure RNase P in Cy5/ATTO647, reactions were then tested on the QuantStudio-6 in the 384-well format with freshly extracted wastewater samples.
