It is not clear whether there is an association between adverse reactions and immune response after vaccination. Similarly, median neutralization activity indicated in IC50 was 1.3-fold higher in vaccinees with severe adverse reactions (p = 0.005), while subgroup analysis confirmed improved separation in men (median 769 versus 485; 1.6-fold; p < 0.001) and no significance in women (median 583 versus 513; p = 0.63) (Figure 1B).A T-cell-mediated immune response in ELISpot analysis was detectable in 30 vaccinees (79.0%) with severe adverse reactions and 25 vaccinees (65.8%) without or only minor injection side symptoms (p = 0.31). None of the studies chose participants according to adverse reactions but compared adverse reactions and antibody levels in a population at hand.
