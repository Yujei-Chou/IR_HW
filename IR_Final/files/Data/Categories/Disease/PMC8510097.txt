We report the design and synthesis of a series of new 5-chloropyridinyl esters of salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and related aromatic carboxylic acids for evaluation against SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease enzyme. Commercially available 2-hydroxy-3-methylbenzoic acid (30 mg, 0.20 mmol) was esterified with 5-chloropyridin-3-ol (31.0 mg, 0.24 mmol) by following the procedure for ester 6a to provide the title monoester 13a (10 mg, 19%), and diester 13b (17 mg, 22%) as amorphous solid.13a: 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) delta 10.41 (s, 1H), 8.51 (d, J = 27.8 Hz, 2H), 7.89 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.71-7.63 (m, 1H), 7.44 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 1H), 6.89 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 1H), 1.56 (s, 3H).; IC50 values were determined for compounds that covalently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro using our recently described assay and data fitting methods that were derived from our previous work on SARS-CoV 3CLpro and inhibition by chloropyridyl esters.
