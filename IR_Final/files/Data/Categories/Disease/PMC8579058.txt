The COVID-19 pandemic deeply affected how schools and families functioned through most of 2020. More precisely, research has highlighted the existence of "divides," which can be particularly problematic when schools are closed. Furthermore, fear of academic failure was measured using three items (alpha = 0.58) created to assess parental fear of failure concerning their child(ren)'s schooling (e.g., "I feel that my child will fall behind academically"; see SM for the entire scale), ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 7 (totally agree).Participants were asked to indicate if they provided homework help in normal times (0 = no, 1 = yes) and, if so, its frequency per week (from 1 day to 7 days per week) as well as the average duration per day (from 1 = less than 30 minutes a day to 5 = more than 3 hours a day).
