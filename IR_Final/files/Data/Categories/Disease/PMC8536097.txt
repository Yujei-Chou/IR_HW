Social contextual factors could determine mortality by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with social capital as a potential determinant. Given this background, this study aimed to examine the association between prefecture-level social capital and COVID-19 deaths in Japan. We calculated the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 individuals in 47 prefectures from 1 October to 31 December 2020 (first 3-month period from the JACSIS survey), from 1 January to 31 March 2021 (second 3-month period from the survey), and from 1 April to 30 June 2021 (third 3-month period from the survey).We used five social capital indicators in this study which included the following: (i) trust in neighbors, (ii) norm of reciprocity in the neighborhood, (iii) trust in the national government, (iv) neighborhood ties, and (v) social participation.
