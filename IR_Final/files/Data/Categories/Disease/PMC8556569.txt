The rapid spread and evolution of various strains of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, continues to challenge the disease controlling measures globally. Additionally, the delta CT values between dry swab and VTM-RNA confirms the validity of the above claim, wherein the dry swab samples stored at 4  C shows negative to no difference in the delta CT values when compared to VTM-RNA samples (supplementary figure 2).The entire procedure of dry swab-based direct RT-PCR involves hardly any laborious steps except adding TE-P buffer for extracting the sample for preparing RT-PCR template. As there is no transportation required, the direct collection of swabs into buffer would increase the turnover time drastically when thousands of samples are being tested.
