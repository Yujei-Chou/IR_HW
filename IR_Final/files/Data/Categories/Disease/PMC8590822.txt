In human history, pandemics have always had a significant impact on humans and civilizations. for distribution and not on better coordination among government agencies (although that may have helped).The COVID-19 pandemic had all the elements to be an excellent liberal case for the importance of collaboration. Is it possible that from now on, pandemics will be handled through bilateral relationships instead of global health diplomacy out of international intuitions and global participants?
