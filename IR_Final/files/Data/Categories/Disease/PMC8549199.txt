Novel Coronavirus disease has affected almost all the countries; which leads to the pandemic, impacting adversely on environment. The range of average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations was 30.44 mug/m3 (Karni Singh) and 84.41 mug/m3 (Arya Nagar) to 111.19 mug/m3 (ITO) and 212.10 mug/m3 (North Campus) during lockdown II, which was slightly higher than that observed during lockdown I. The highest PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were observed in ITO and Bawana (211.10 mug/m3 and 275.04 mug/m3, respectively) because the supply of essential goods from the manufacturing sector, wholesale sector, retail sector, and shops was permitted. The System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research reported that dust particles transported from Rajasthan were likely to be the dominant factor contribution to increased particulate matter concentration during lockdown IV.
