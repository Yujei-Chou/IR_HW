Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has been associated with cardiac pathology raising the possibility of serious cardiac arrhythmias among athletes returning to competition post infection. We compared those athletes who tested positive to COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction diagnostic testing (16 athletes) to athletes who (i) tested negative and (ii) had no symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection (n = 8).Our hypothesis was that electrocardiogram, biochemical, and imaging variants are common in highly trained athletes and would not be more prevalent in athletes recovering from COVID-19 than non-infected teammates. Prior studies may have been compromised by a tendency to recruit athletes with symptoms sufficient to warrant testing.
