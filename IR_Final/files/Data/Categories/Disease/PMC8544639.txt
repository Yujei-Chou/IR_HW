Objective: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is urgently sought during public health crises. Predominant safety considerations involved the quantity and duration of ozone exposure after opening the sterilization unit post-cycle (i.e., with an internal concentration of ~30-32 ppm), as well as the effects of leaving the lid half or fully open during the sterilization cycle. Our study was primarily directed at discovering the potential of ozone in the disinfection of PPE.
