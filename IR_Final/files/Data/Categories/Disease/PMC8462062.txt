The pandemic in 2020 caused an abrupt change in the emission of anthropogenic aerosols and their precursors. Consequently, the anthropogenic aerosol forcing in EC-Earth3 includes a contribution from the cloud lifetime or second indirect effect.base: new MACv2-SP properties from the baseline for the year 2020 (2020-base) and 2050 (2050-base).2020-blp: new MACv2-SP properties from the two-year-blip for 2020,2050: new MACv2-SP properties for 2050 from the recovery scenarios that are either primarily fossil-fuel based (2050-ff), moderate (2050-mg) or strong green (2050-sg)pi: without anthropogenic aerosol effects for calculating the ERF in 2020 and 2050 relative to the pre-industrial. Our simulations use annually repeating aerosol optical properties and associated effects on clouds for the years 2020 and 2050.
