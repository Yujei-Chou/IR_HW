Early diagnosis with rapid detection of the virus plays a key role in preventing the spread of infection and in treating patients effectively. The RT-LAMP LoD for the N2 primer set with the WarmStart enzyme mix in 20 microL reaction volume was approximately 300 RNA molecules in saliva (Figure 2B), which is within the range reported by Kellner et al.. The LoDs for N2 and E1 primer sets with the Isothermal Master Mix in 15 microL reaction volume were 119 and 70, respectively (Figure 2C).A singleplex with the N1 primer-probe set and multiplex RT-qPCR with N1 and N2 primer-probe sets detected the viral RNA at approximately 10 RNA copies per reaction (Cq < 40) (Figure 2D,E). The saliva obtained from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals was used to determine the analytical specificity for RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP.
