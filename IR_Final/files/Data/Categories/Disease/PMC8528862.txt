Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic concerns were raised regarding infection of new animal hosts and the effect on viral epidemiology. Concerning the Spike Wt and Spike Opt antigens, a slight increase was observed in levels of SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific T-cell differentiation for the Spike Opt antigens when stimulated with low concentration SARS-CoV-2 S1 antigen, but this difference is no longer noticeable when stimulations were performed with 5 microg of S1 (bars with yellow stripes).To determine whether the humoral immune response also resulted in mucosal immunity, tracheal swabs were taken at the end of the experiment. Blood was collected and lymphocytes were isolated using Sepmate tubes (Stemcell) containing Histopaque 1083 according to the manufacturer's instructions.
