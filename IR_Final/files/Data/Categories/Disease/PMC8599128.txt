The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemics caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading around the world due to its high infection rate, long incubation period, as well as lack of effective diagnosis and therapy or vaccines, which is tearing global health systems apart. In our manuscript, we summarized recent advances of nanomaterials for the diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19. Thus, the use of nanomaterials displays great potential in developing novel therapeutic strategies for the therapy of COVID-19.As mentioned in the introduction, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a critical role in its infection mechanism, which is similar to MERS-CoV. Based on the interaction between S protein and ACE2 on the host cell membrane, already existing antiviral nanomaterials can be used to treat COVID-19.
