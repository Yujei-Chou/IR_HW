Binge watching is becoming increasingly common and may impact energy balance and body weight. Out of the 10 negative binge watching behaviors, eating while binge watching and binge watching due to boredom were the most commonly practiced in our sample, with only 9.4% and 9.9% of the sample, respectively, reporting "never" engaging in the behaviors in the past seven days (Table 4).Frequency of eating while binge watching differed by stress tertile (2(2) = 23.116, p < 0.001), with the high stress tertile having a higher frequency compared with the low (p < 0.001) and moderate (p = 0.001) stress tertiles (Figure 4). Our findings add to previous research suggesting a pathological dimension to binge watching by revealing a relationship with higher BMI and increased eating while binge watching.
