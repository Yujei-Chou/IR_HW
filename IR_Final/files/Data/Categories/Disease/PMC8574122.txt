Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a serious threat to global health. In a study on 76 patients with COVID-19 and 69 healthy individuals from Hong Kong and Atlanta, GA, USA, Arunachalam and colleagues observed in the myeloid cells from patients with COVID-19 reduced expression of human leukocyte antigen class DR (HLA-DR) and of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as impaired mTOR signaling and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), which correlated with disease severity. The increasing and converging literature data that we have presented herein suggest that inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway represent a valuable asset in the management of COVID-19 infection (Fig.
