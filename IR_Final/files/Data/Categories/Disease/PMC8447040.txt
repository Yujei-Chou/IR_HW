Abstract
The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a global challenge, with over 135 million confirmed cases and over 2.9 million deaths at the time of writing (World Health Organization weekly report 11 April). Especially in cases with a short disease duration (5-6 days), peribronchovascular consolidation was histologically mirrored by a prominent neutrophil infiltration (bronchopneumonia) indicating an early innate inflammatory response. This is in line with studies in acute interstitial pneumonia demonstrating that HRCT findings were not specific for the pathological findings.
