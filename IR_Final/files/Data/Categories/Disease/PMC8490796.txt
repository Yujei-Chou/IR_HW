Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus causes a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to mild, moderate, or severe illness with multi-organ failure and death. This perspective thus highlights the need for proactive efforts to reevaluate the current variables/strategies in accounting for symptomless and waning fractions. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 immunization, determining IgM antibodies early in the event (within 2 weeks that may persist up to nearly 3 weeks following disease onset or immunization) and IgG antibodies (beyond 2 weeks until several months after infection or immunization), have been evidently recognized to be more informative for evaluating antibody-based immunological responses with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.
