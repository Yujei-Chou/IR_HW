Background: Allergic and nonallergic adverse reactions have been reported with global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. Testing protocols were adapted from Banerji et al.9,16 For patients with negative or inconclusive skin testing to PEG3350, and concern for a risk of reaction to the mRNA vaccine, an in-office oral graded challenge to PEG3350 was offered. The majority of our patients with anaphylaxis to the first COVID-19 vaccine received second dose at the high-risk clinic.
