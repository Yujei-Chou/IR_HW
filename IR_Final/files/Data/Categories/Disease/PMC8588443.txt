This research examines hoteliers' perceptions and strategies in light of the Covid-19 pandemic and their predictions about an uncertain industry that has shifted attention to safety and hygiene concerns to regain guests' trust. Findings show that those hoteliers who anticipated the domestic business travel segment to be the first contributor to hotel recovery also expected guests to show a greater concern for health and safety precautions when booking a hotel, when compared to those hoteliers who selected the international leisure travel segment as the first contributor to hotel recovery (Mdomestic_business = 6.80, SD = .40 vs Minternational_leisure = 6.25, SD = .78; t (55) = 3.55, p = .001). More studies are needed to evaluate the progress of the crisis and to understand additional opportunities and challenges to hotels around the world.
