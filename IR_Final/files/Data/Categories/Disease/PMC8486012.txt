Introduction: Older adults are more susceptible to severe COVID-19, with increased all-cause mortality. Although multimorbidity has been consistently associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in geriatric patients, its specificity is highly debated. The mean in-hospital stay was 13 days, and in-hospital mortality was 60.3%.The risk of in-hospital mortality due to COVID-19 was higher for men (OR = 2.1; 95%CI 1.2, 4.0; p = 0.017), for older patients (>85 years vs. younger OR = 2.0; 95%CI 1.1, 3.9; p = 0.026) and for patients with dementia or cerebral-vascular disease (OR = 2.3; 95%CI 1.2, 4.7; p = 0.017), adjusted for CIRS-C and CIRS-S (Table 2).We clustered patients into three groups based on their comorbidity pattern (Figure 1).
