The rapid spread of the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has created an unusual situation, with rapid searches for compounds to interfere with the biological processes exploited by the virus. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4  C with anti-ACE2 mouse monoclonal antibody AC18Z (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or anti-beta-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (1:5000, Sigma Aldrich). Gentamicin did not significantly modify GFP transduction in either cell line indicating the specificity of doxycycline's effect (Figure 1E,F and Figure S2).Doxycycline was more effective in inhibiting the transduction of Vero E6 than HEK293-ACE cells, as indicated by the IC50 (16.92 +- 1.55 microM for Vero E6 and 58.81 +- 1.45 microM for HEK293-ACE2, p < 0.0001) or comparing the effects of 100 microM doxycycline on the two cell types; we observed 62.5 % and 38.5% inhibition of transduction in Vero E6 and HEK293-ACE2, respectively (Figure 1D).
