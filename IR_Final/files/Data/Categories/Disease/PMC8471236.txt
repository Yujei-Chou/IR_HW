The newly developed COVID-19 vaccines have established a safe profile, yet some individuals experience a wide range of adverse events. Two studies did not report the number of doses that the patients received before developing symptoms. The most commonly involved dermatome was T4 (12/91) (Table 1 and Table 2).Most cases (23/91) were treated with valacyclovir as monotherapy while a fraction of the patients (12/91) received valacyclovir in combination with a second antiviral agent (i.e., Fusidic acid, Acyclovir).
