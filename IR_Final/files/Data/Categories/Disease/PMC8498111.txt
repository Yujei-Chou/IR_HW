The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants that escape vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies has indicated the importance of T cell responses against this virus. As indicated in Figures 2C,D, immunization peptides with CUK2 significantly increased the proportion of CD44hiCD62Llow effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (TEM cells) in the spleen and CD8+ TEM cells in the draining lymph nodes compared with the non-immunized group (G1). Similarly, splenocyte culture supernatants from the RNA adjuvant+peptide mixture-immunized group (G4) showed significantly increased IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, and IL-6 levels (Supplementary Figure S1).
