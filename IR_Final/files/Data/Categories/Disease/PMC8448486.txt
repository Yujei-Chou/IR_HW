Abstract
Serious adverse events such as vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; previously observed in other vaccines) are a concern with worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 vaccinations. Petechiae and ecchymosis develop at platelet levels between 10,000 and 30,000/muL, and mucosal bleeding and hemorrhage are associated with levels <10,000/muL. In this article, we described 2 cases of ITP in healthy young women presenting 2 to 11 days post-dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech messenger RNA severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine with platelet counts of <20,000/muL treated successfully with IVIG and steroids, respectively. Instances of symptom onset associated with thrombocytopenia are reported anywhere from 1 to 23 days post-vaccination with the AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Pfizer vaccines.
