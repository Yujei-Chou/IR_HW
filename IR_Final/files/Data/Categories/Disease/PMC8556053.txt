Abstract
Acute stroke (AS) is the most common time-dependent pathology attended in the emergency medical service (EMS) of Madrid (SUMMA 112). Chi-square test has been used to compare categorical variables. Also, a lower proportion of women were attended with suspected stroke (COVID-19: 43.9%, 95% CI: 38.2%-49.7%; pre-COVID-19 51.9%, 95% CI: 46.4%-57.2%; influenza 53.3%, 95% CI: 48.8%-57.8%) (Table 1).Finally, there was also a non-significant reduction in transfer rates to stroke centers (87% vs 90%, P = .61) at the cost of increasing transfers to hospitals without stroke units (5% vs 3%, P = .17).Our EMS (SUMMA 112) did not detect a significant decrease in SC cases during the COVID-19 period (Fig.
