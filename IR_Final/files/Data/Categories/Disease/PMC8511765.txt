The purpose of this study was to examine multiple direct and indirect pathways of the association between older age and mental health through COVID-19-related stress perceptions, meaning in life, and forgiveness of situations. Results of a meta-analysis show that meaning is also inversely related to post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity (Schafer et al.,), Participants age 65 and older experienced less COVID-19-related stress perceptions which was associated with more forgiveness of situations which was associated with better mental health, and this serial indirect association was statistically significant (B = 0.01, beta = 0.01, 95% CI of B = 0.01-0.03).The present study sought to examine direct and indirect pathways through which older age was associated with better mental health during the height of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States from April 2020 to July 2020.
