The COVID-19 virus has devastated lives and economies worldwide. Our nurse team responding to the screening included three major components: (1) establishing a leadership group and a nucleic acid sampling emergency team; (2) defining, conducting, and evaluating nurse training; (3) implementing efficient sampling schemes (10 in 1 mixed sample technique). The large-scale nucleic acid detection sampling task that was successfully completed in 4 days confirms their assessment again.
