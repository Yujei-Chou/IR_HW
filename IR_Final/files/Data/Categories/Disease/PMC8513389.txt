The densely glycosylated spike (S) protein highly exposed on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) surface mediates host cell entry by binding to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Even with the same HEK 293 cell system, the two variants using two different expression media, the equilibrium dissociation constants were different; KD 23.9 nM for S1-HEK-F and KD 6.43 nM for S1-HEK-E (Figures 1C and 1D, respectively).The different strength of S1 protein binding to the ACE2 receptor is likely caused by the different glycosylation of S1 expressed in different systems. SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins were denaturized in the presence of DTT and IAA before digestion with trypsin.
