Abstract
Orthopaedic trauma fellowships were forced to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic during the latter part of the 2019 and 2020 interview season when many hospitals enacted travel restrictions. On average, they received 35.8 applications (SD 14.5) and completed 19.5 interviews (SD 8.2) (Table 2).Only 13% of FDs reported that their fellowship program offered a virtual interview option (pre-COVID19), while 17% completed virtual interviews due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions during the 2019 and 2020 interview season. Both applicants and FDs demonstrated strong preferences for in-person interviews over remote interviews whether by videoconference or telephone.
