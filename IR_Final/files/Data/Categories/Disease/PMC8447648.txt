Dear authors,
Dear authors,Thank you for the comments. The study conducted in Serrana, a city in the state of Sao Paulo, has proven the effectiveness of the vaccine by concretely reproducing what had been observed in the phase 3 trial. A percentage of 95.7% of the adult population vaccinated (vaccinated population = 27,160), from February to April 2021, resulted in 95% reduction in deaths, 86% reduction in hospitalizations, and 80% reduction in symptomatic cases.
