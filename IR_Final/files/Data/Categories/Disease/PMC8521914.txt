Objectives: To develop and test a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination intervention that includes healthcare team training activities and patient reminders to reduce missed opportunities and improves the rate of appointment scheduling for HPV vaccination in a rural medical clinic in the United States. The number of providers and support staff completing the pre-intervention and post-intervention surveys did not change (n = 17). The results of this study suggest that, among rural patients aged 18 and older, those receiving a clinic HPV vaccination reminder, regardless of the mode, are 6.96 times more likely to schedule or intend to schedule a follow-up visit for vaccination for either their child or themselves (cOR = 6.96, 95% CI 2.44-22.79).
