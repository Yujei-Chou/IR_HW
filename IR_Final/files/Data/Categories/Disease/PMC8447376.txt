Abstract
This study shows an independent deleterious association between SARS-CoV-2 and decreased hand grip strength (HGS).Decrease in HGS was only significant in those individuals whose SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred early in the study, allowing for a greater interval before follow-up measurements. SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals were 2.27 times more likely (95% CI: 1.33-3.87) to have a lower HGS than those who remained seronegative (Table 2).Further analysis by means of mixed models (using continuous baseline and follow-up values for each subject as his/her own control) demonstrated that the difference in baseline HGS among those who became seropositive compared with those who remained seronegative at follow-up was not significant (beta: -1.43; 95% CI: -3.51 to 0.66; p = 0.178). Results of the present study that show no increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals with lower baseline HGS measurements argue against this conjecture.
