Aims: As the country with the seventh largest number of People with Diabetes (PWD) in the world, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the Large Social Scale Restriction (LSSR) policy taken by the Indonesian government to reduce the number of COVID-19 transmissions is estimated to interfere diabetes management and will increase the incidence of diabetes complications. Other factors that play a role on increasing number of incidences were found in PWD under 60 years of age (PR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.12-1.85) and those receiving insulin therapy (PR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.75-2.85).The study shows that, the majority of PWD did not take any action in maintaining/resolving their diabetes health-related problems during the COVID pandemic in Indonesia. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been inequality in the management of T2DM in Indonesia.
