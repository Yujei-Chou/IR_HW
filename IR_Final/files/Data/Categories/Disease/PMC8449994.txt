Background
Within six years of establishing a division for direct lending for health in 1979, the World Bank1 became the largest financial investor in health to countries in the Global South. With these cases in mind, future social scientific research into the World Bank's role in shaping policy knowledge and expertise about health should consider two main questions. ,).To further unpack the Bank's economic power and financial influence, we identify three main research questions: (1) in what ways has the WBG influenced the way that the "public" and the "private" are conceived in global health, (2) to what extent and through what vehicles has it embraced a "selective" approach to primary health care, and (3) what types of influence has it exerted through its trust fund infrastructure, such as through performance-based financing and its financing of Global Partnership Programs?The first question can be approached by "following the money."
