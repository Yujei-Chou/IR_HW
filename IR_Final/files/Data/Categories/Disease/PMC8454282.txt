In a geographically diverse U.S. population, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was not associated with a significant difference in adverse pregnancy outcomes, even when considering severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection status. With logistic regression modeling, after adjustment for potential confounders, there was similarly no significant association between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and preterm birth or cesarean birth (Table 5).Of the 7,432 women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the majority (n=6,842, 92%) were tested during the third trimester of pregnancy compared with the first or second trimesters (n=590, 8%). Compared with women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the third trimester, those who were positive in the first or second trimester of pregnancy were more likely to have private insurance, more likely to be obese, more likely to have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pregestational diabetes, more likely to live in the Midwest, and less likely to live in an urban area (Appendix 2, available online at http://links.lww.com/AOG/C409).
