Background: This study was conducted to evaluate the technical and clinical success of trans-arterial embolization (TAE) as a treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and to describe its safety; moreover, we describe the characteristics of these patients. Conclusions: Our study highlights the most frequent characteristics of COVID-19 patients with GIB. Re-embolization was considered when clinical stability was not achieved during follow-up and/or evidence of persistent or new GI bleeding was demonstrated on a new angio-CT.Safety was defined as procedure related morbidity and was evaluated according to the Society of Interventional Radiology guidelines.
