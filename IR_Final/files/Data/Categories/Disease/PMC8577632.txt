Over the past decade, countries such as France, Belgium, Denmark, Austria, Latvia, and Bulgaria have banned face-coverings from public spaces. However, I have not yet considered whether the costs and burdens of such bans are unreasonable. If effective, this approach would ensure that no-one with deep commitments to appearing in public with a covered face is forced to show her face in public except in situations where this is necessary for purposes of identification (e.g. at airport security checks), while simultaneously ensuring that those with mere preferences for covering their face in public:perhaps in order to reduce the probability of being exposed to interactive overtures from strangers, or perhaps in order to simply experience what it is like to be fully veiled in public:would still be denied the right to do so.
