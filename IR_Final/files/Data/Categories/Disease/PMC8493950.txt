Evidence on the within-person changes of healthcare workers' mental health across waves of COVID-19 cases during this pandemic is absent. The contrasts compared the baseline versus each one of the remaining conditions of the COVID-19 contagion. Regarding differences by regions, in the first measurement, the level of anxiety was lower in healthcare workers from inside the country region than those from the metropolitan region (t(302.17) =  - 2.38, p = 0.02), while in the follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference among them (t(288.95) =  - 1.57, p = 0.12).We evaluated the need to analyze nested models by regions, but allowing the intercepts to vary across regions did not significantly improve the model fit (AICstart = 2431.63, AICfinal = 2433.62, p = 0.90; Fig.
