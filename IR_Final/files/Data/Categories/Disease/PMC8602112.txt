The aim of this study was to analyze the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on 120 patients with schizophrenia, and their caregivers (control group), in the city of Arica, northern Chile. The hypotheses of this study hold that (1) self-reports of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among patients and caregivers would be positively correlated, (2) caregivers would self-report a greater impact of the pandemic on their daily lives, and (3) patients infected with COVID-19 would experience lower levels of mental health improvement and higher levels of psychological distress. In relation to the first hypothesis, the results showed that the perceptions of patients and caregivers about the pandemic's impact were positively correlated.
