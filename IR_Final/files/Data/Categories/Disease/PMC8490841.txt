In April 2020, close to the start of the first U.K. COVID-19 lockdown, the U.K. government announced the development of a COVID-19 contact tracing app, which was later trialled on the U.K. island, the Isle of Wight, in May/June 2020. These findings correlated with scholars' more general calls for the need to foreground public trust during the development of contact-tracing apps (Bengio et al.; Reasons for not downloading the app included technological limitations (interviewee 11 had an older model phone) and critical beliefs about the app and the U.K. government more broadly ((interviewee 4); see below).This suggested a more complex relationship between the U.K. government (failing to) provide open and transparent information about the app (something called for by scholars as an aspect of trustworthiness) and views on the technology.
