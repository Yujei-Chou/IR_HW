Background: Recent studies reported, during the COVID-19 pandemic, increased mental distress among the general population and among women around the childbirth period. A subgroup analysis by periods was performed to evaluate whether parental outcomes differed according to unit of admission of their newborn (NICU vs. semi-intensive) using a Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney test. All tests performed were two tailed and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
