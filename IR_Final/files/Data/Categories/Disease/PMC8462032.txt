Prisons are high-risk settings for COVID-19 and present specific challenges for prevention and control. We performed a retrospective analysis of routine data collected during the COVID-19 emergency in prison. On 18 April, active case finding was expanded to all individuals housed in BX, fourth floor, leading to the identification of three more asymptomatic confirmed cases (PP14-PP16) (Figure 2).An additional cluster of two cases was identified on the third floor of BX on 6 April (PP17 and PP18).
