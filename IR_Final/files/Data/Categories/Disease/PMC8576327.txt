The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a major global crisis that has infected public social mentality. Besides, the correlations between PoM and social support at the same time point (i.e., PoM-T1 and social support-T1; PoM-T2 and social support-T2; PoM-T3 and social support-T3) all reached a significance level of.001.Prior to validating the hypotheses, we tested a measurement model which included all the six latent variables (i.e., PoM and social support measured at the three points) as the baseline model (refer to the two-step method; Anderson and Gerbing,). Second, this study adopted a cross-lag approach to testing the reciprocal relationship between PoM and social support that has rarely been touched upon in previous research (Yang et al.,;
