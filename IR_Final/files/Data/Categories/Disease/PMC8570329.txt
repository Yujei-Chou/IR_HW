The following are available online at , S1: Likelihood Ratio Tests for multinominal logistic regression with 'Yes, Definitely' get a vaccine as reference category and using all other variables categorical, Table S2: Multinominal logistic regression with 'Yes, Definitely' get a vaccine as reference category and using all other variables categorical; Table S3: Multiple regression predicting intention to get a COVID-19 vaccine in wave 2 in the 5 imputed datasets and pooled results.
