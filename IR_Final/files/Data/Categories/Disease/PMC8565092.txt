This study reviewed cases of appendicitis following administration of COVID-19 vaccines reported to VigiBase, the WHO database of individual case safety reports (ICSRs). Seriousness of the ICSR is determined by the case reporter, prior to uploading to VigiBase, and is defined by the International Conference of Harmonisation seriousness criteria (results in death, is life threatening, caused or prolonged hospitilisation, results in persistent or significant disability, is a congenital birth defect or is a medically important condition).As of 27th May 2021, an estimated 1.82 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines had been administered, there were 900,695 ICSRs in VigiBase for COVID-19 vaccines, and of these 358 ICSRs reported appendicitis. COVID-19 status is an important consideration as previous infection may enhance the immune response to vaccination.
