Dear Editor:
Dear Editor:The SARS-CoV-2 disease pandemic, characterised by a high level of infection, has increased the morbidity and mortality rate among the world's population, exceeding the capacity of public health services in the affected countries to control epidemiology and care for infected patients in isolated settings. The high number of deaths caused by the virus is also affecting the capacity of autopsy or hospital morgue departments for proper corpse storage, timely cremation and delivery of bodies to relatives for proper burial in accordance with established safety protocols for funeral services. Moreover, according to the research, human beings are not meant to live or die alone.
