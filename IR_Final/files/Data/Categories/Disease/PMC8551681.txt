Summary
Typhoid fever, once endemic in high-income countries, remains a major public health concern in low-resource settings where there is inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene conditions, including Nepal. The protective efficacy of TCV was 83 4% (95% CI 60 5-93 0) in the first 12 months of follow-up compared with 73 0% (95% CI 37 9-88 3) after the first year (p=0 43 for the difference in vaccine efficacy between year 1 and year 2; table 3).There were 13 cases of blood culture-confirmed paratyphoid fever, seven in the TCV group and six in the MenA group (vaccine efficacy -16 7%, 95% CI -247 4 to 60 8%; p=0 78).Table 4 shows the anti-Vi IgG and IgA response in the TCV group and MenA group. At 28 days post-vaccination, 664 (97%) of 683 in the TCV group and six (2%) of 380 in the MenA group had Vi-IgA seroconversion, whereas 677 (99%) of 683 in the TCV group and eight (2%) of 380 in the MenA group had anti-Vi IgG seroconversion (as previously reported).
