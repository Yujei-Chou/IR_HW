During the COVID-19 pandemic, the collapse of the public transit ridership led to significant budget deficits due to dramatic decreases in fare revenues. This is complemented by an evaluation that redesigns the network to take into account the change in demand and additional cleaning costs. For the late pandemic scenario, direct shuttle trips decrease by 6.3%, while bus utilization increases from 10% to 18%.Redesigning the network results in $2.0k (1.9%) savings for the early pandemic scenario, and $2.9k (4.3%) savings for the late pandemic scenario.
