Abstract
The United States (US) Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides healthcare at no or low cost to eligible veterans and is delivered mainly through VA clinics and facilities. Due to the emerging body of evidence regarding health needs for persons infected with SARS-CoV-2, we excluded 1524 PWH who had an indication of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR laboratory test up to 28 February 2021. Additionally, we identified for each year those with at least one outpatient International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10) diagnosis code for AUD using codes F10.1x, F10.2x or tobacco use/smoking using codes Z72.0x, F17.21, Z87.891.For each month of 1 March 2019 to 29 February 2020 (2019) and 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021 (2020), we summarized counts of GM/ID clinic visits (in-person vs. virtual), HIV-1 RNA VL tests, ARV prescriptions by length, AUDIT-C administered and tobacco use responses collected.
