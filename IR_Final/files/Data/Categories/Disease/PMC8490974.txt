Non-technical summaries of research projects allow tracking the numbers and purpose of animal experiments related to SARS-CoV2 research so as to provide greater transparency on animal use. One explanation for this trend is the continued interest in disease pathology and its clinical consequences, and research on other treatment strategies against COVID-19, such as the use of convalescent serum or monoclonal antibodies (Taylor et al,).... in Germany, only 0.8% of all animals and 2.1% of projects using animals were authorized for research on SARS-CoV-2.Although we can only analyze animal experiments approved in Germany, it is likely that our results translate to other countries that have intensified their research on SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis of NTS demonstrates that current trends in biomedical research can be delineated in terms of prospective animal usage.
