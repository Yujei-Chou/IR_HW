Older people have been a central focus during the COVID-19 pandemic, as more than 90% of deaths in the UK have been among people aged 60 years or older. Older people with physical disabilities had significantly greater odds of having anxiety (odds ratio 2 23 [95% CI 1 72-2 89]; p<0 0001) and depression (1 78 [1 44-2 19]; p<0 0001) than their peers without physical disabilities, even after taking into account pre-pandemic differences. As a result, social contacts will have been reduced more among people with disabilities than among people without disabilities, as Steptoe and Di Gessa show, and shielding did in part explain the effects on loneliness among people with disabilities.
