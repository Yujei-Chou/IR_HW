Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with fatal pulmonary fibrosis. P-values were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (two-sided) in R. To design siRNAs with seed sequences (6mers or more in positions 2-8) of antifibrotic miRNAs (miR-27, miR-193a-5p, miR-486, miR-151, and miR-455), target sites were selected in the siRNA-accessible regions (Pexp > 0.1) of SARS-CoV-2 gRNA (NC_045512) based on calculations using the optimised parameters (u = 8 and L = 20).siRNA and miRNA were synthesised (Supplementary Table S1) using custom RNA synthesis services provided by Bioneer (Korea). Total 14,028 target sites (antifibrotic miRNAs, n = 75; high-confident human miRNAs, n = 13,953) were identified in SARS-CoV-2 gRNA, offering exposure probability (Pexp), and inferred AGO binding regions (Fig.
