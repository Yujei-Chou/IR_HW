In April 2020, the American Heart Association (AHA) Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC) Committee and Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation Adult and Pediatric Task Forces published their Interim Guidance for Basic and Advanced Cardiac Life Support in Adults, Children, and Neonates With Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Chest compressions can be performed initially by a chest compressor with or without a surgical mask until relieved by responders with appropriate PPE for AGPs. For communities and facilities with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 and lower immunization rates, the continuous use of an N-95 respirator and eye protection should be considered when the patient's COVID-19 status is unknown and resuscitation involves AGP interventions to which compressors and other personnel will be exposed.
