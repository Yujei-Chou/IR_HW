The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of individual infection control measures and physical distancing on pediatric medical care in a local prefecture in Japan, where the incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in pediatric patients was extremely low. Compared with the incidence of COVID-19 in many other countries and the urban regions of Japan, the COVID-19 epidemic within the prefecture was light in 2020.The present study demonstrated that both the number of outpatients and inpatients decreased remarkably in a setting where COVID-19 was controlled. We speculate that the suppression of social life has had a significant negative impact on the psychological status of children in addition to their parents.
