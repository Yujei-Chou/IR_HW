We report the case of a patient with symptoms of myelopathy following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent review characterized myelitis in presumed relation to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, if SARS-CoV-2 is considered as a possible trigger to an inflammatory disorder, whether this represents a monophasic - acute/subacute - response or rather a first manifestation of a chronic recurrent debilitating disorder such as NMOSD is also undetermined.
