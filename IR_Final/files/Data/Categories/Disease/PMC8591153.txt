Our clinical practice is contextualized by a co-participant trauma constituted by a confluence of upheavals-pandemic, politics, an epistemological crisis, pervasive distrust of expertise and evidence. Not only is the rapidity of change traumatically destabilizing but it is also layered on top of structural disruptions that predate them and which provoke massive anxieties:political upheaval, climate change, geographical disruption and mass migration, the threat of terrorism, to say nothing of reconsideration of what it means to be human and lastly, but not least, what Baudrillard called the "perfect crime" (i.e., the murder of reality).This isn't to say that that psychoanalysis has not previously had to respond to elements of these crises. Can an internal world be explored when surrounded by a confluence of trauma that force attention outward?
