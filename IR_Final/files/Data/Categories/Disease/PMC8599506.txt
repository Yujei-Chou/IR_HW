Outbreak of global pandemic Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has so far caused countless morbidity and mortality. A systemic comparison of normotensive COVID-19 patients with the hypertensives demonstrated that later were older (44.5 +- 11.9 vs. 60.2 +- 14.2, p < 0.001) and presented higher heart rate (86.0 +- 12.1 vs. 89.8 +- 14.9, p < 0.05), incidence of fever (40.3% vs. 53.3%, p < 0.05), sputum production (2.2% vs. 12.0%, p < 0.001) and shortness of breath (1.3% vs. 17.3%, p < 0.001). Further logistic regression analysis showed that HTN was associated with increased LDH (p = 0.001) and CK-MB (p = 0.05) in COVID- 19 patients after adjusting age, gender, and comorbidity of diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (Table 4).Previous studies have demonstrated that inflammatory cells such as macrophage and T cells in HTN infiltrate into the heart and results in cardiac and other end-organ damage.
