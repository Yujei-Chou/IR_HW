shows the de novo prevalence of anti-Spike S1 immunoglobulin G antibody levels in humoral responsive participants to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination at the time point T2 in medical personnel, dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients. While levels of anti-Spike S1 IgG antibody titres were independent of vaccine type in medical personnel, these titres were significantly higher in dialysis patients as well as in transplant recipients using mRNA-1273 vaccine compared to BNT162b2 mRNA.
