This article discusses the latest research that reveals that children seem to be facing new risks of sexual violence in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic. During COVID-19, school closures and limited police presence have left young girls increasingly exposed to FGM. This finding is corroborated by evidence from forensic medical examiners at gender-based violence recovery centers in Kenya who have noted that survivors attending hospitals for SGBV violations during COVID-19 are now younger and mostly below the age of 16.Second, school closures and reduced parental monitoring have coincided with an increase in offenses perpetrated by individuals known to the survivor.
