Background
Since March 2020, millions of Americans across the US have been impacted by the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its subsequent restrictions and disruptions to daily life. We hypothesized that: 1) caregivers who strictly adhere to social distancing measures would report higher odds of feeling worried/anxious when compared to caregivers who do not strictly adhere to social distancing measures; 2) caregivers who felt bothered by withdrawal from activities of interest would report higher odds of feeling worried/anxious when compared to caregivers who do not feel bothered by withdrawal from activities of interest. Caregivers who felt bothered by withdrawal from activities of interest had 4.11 times higher odds of reporting feeling worried/anxious when compared to their counterparts who were not bothered by withdrawal from activities of interest (AOR = 4.11, p < .001, 95% C.I. = 2.32-7.24).Age, race/ethnicity, education, and number of children in the household were not significantly associated with feeling worried/anxious.
