Dear Editor,
Dear Editor,This letter brought up the issue of improving social awareness of healthcare workers (HCWs) who are suffering from an increased workload in the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The author argued that a national and social project should be implemented for medical professionals that would include guaranteed salaries, the provision of protective equipment in a timely manner, and campaigns or public advertisements exalting HCWs working at the forefront of quarantine to prevent the healthcare system from collapsing due to burnout and withdrawal of HCWs. We fully agree with the author's argument that appropriate compensation and awareness of HCWs' work should be implemented.
