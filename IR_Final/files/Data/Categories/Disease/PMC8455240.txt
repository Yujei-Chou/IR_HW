By September 1, 2021, SARS-CoV-2, a respiratory virus that prompted Coronavirus Disease in 2019, had infected approximately 218,567,442 patients and claimed 4,534,151 lives. The drug-protein interaction was simulated in this study to better understand the mechanism of the proposed SARS-CoV-2 drugs and investigate the inhibitory effect of bexarotene, abiraterone diiodohydroxyquinoline, and cetilistat on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. During simulation, a slight enhancement in the Rg value of the 6LZG-Ceti complex was observed, indicating its structural integrity.
