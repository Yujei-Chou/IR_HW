Given the disruption of cardiology practices by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we sought to investigate whether the number of reports of adverse events attributed to cardiovascular medical devices changed over the course of the pandemic, specifically examining implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and coronary drug-eluting stents (DESs). We performed paired t tests for the differences between weekly reported adverse event types for each event type. Comparing the data from 2019 to 2020 with the data from 2020 to 2021, we found that there were, on average, approximately 2.6 fewer weekly reports of ICD-attributed deaths during the pandemic than there were in the prepandemic year, a decrease of approximately 45.8% (p <0.0001) (Figure 1 ).
