Sound surgical judgment, patient selection, and operative technique are imperative to operate safely on patients with COVID-19.See Article page XXX.Since January 20, 2020, when the first patient in the United States was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the United States and health care providers have treated, protected themselves from, adapted to, and learned from the virus that has caused the most significant pandemic of our generation. Some "patients were in progressive respiratory distress that would have resulted in death without surgical intervention," but did surgical intervention hasten this inevitable outcome? Additional caveats exist regarding management of these patients and include viral load, aerosol-generating procedures, as well as optimization of personal protective equipment for the entire team to mitigate further transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to health care providers as well as patients with whom we interact who have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and to our families and community.
