Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emergent, bursting infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 patients with more underlying comorbidities above related to worse prognosis and prolonged virus shedding. To the best of our knowledge, there was no specific antiviral medication for SARS-CoV-2 until now, and most of the drugs undergoing clinical tests with COVID-19 patients were designed for influenza, HIV, Ebola, etc.
