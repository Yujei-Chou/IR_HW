Since the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an array of off-label interventions has been used to treat patients, either provided as compassionate care or tested in clinical trials. There is a challenge in determining the justification for conducting randomised controlled trials over providing compassionate use in an emergency setting. Indeed, although in terms of effective treatment, interventions and protocols for patients with COVID-19, healthcare professionals still face uncertainty, the situation as of time of writing of this paper is dramatically different from the Hubei case in March 2020 both in terms of understanding the diseases and patient profiles and in the experience of medical staff treating patients with COVID-19.
