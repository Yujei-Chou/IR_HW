While mRNA vaccines are proving highly efficacious against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to determine how booster doses and prior infection influence the immune defense they elicit, and whether they protect against variants. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article "mRNA vaccine-induced T cells respond identically to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern but differ in longevity and homing properties depending on prior infection status" for consideration by eLife. In fact our 39-parameter CyTOF panel theoretically allowed us to characterize not only SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells producing IFNg, but also those producing other canonical effector cytokines of CD4+ T cells (IL4 for Th2 cells, IL17 for Th17 cells); however, we did not detect any SARS-CoV-2-specific IL4+ or IL17+ cells, consistent with our prior studies from COVID-19 patients (Neidleman et al.,
