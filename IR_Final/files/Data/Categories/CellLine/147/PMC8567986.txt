Malnutrition causes diseases, immune system disorders, deterioration in physical growth, mental development, and learning capacity worldwide. In another study, rice with high carotenoid content was developed by adding a carotenoid biosynthesis cassette with the CRISPR-Cas9-based method (Dong et al.).CRISPR-Cas9 is seen as a promising strategy in producing more durable and tolerant crops by stimulating the development of multi-resistance to many abiotic and biotic stress factors in non-transgenic but modified by genome-edited plants and in reducing global food scarcity by improving crop quality and yield (Vestergaard et al.). and carbohydrate and protein production in maize increases with Fe nanofertilization (Sharifi et al.).
