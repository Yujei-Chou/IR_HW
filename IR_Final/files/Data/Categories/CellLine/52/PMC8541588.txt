We describe the incidence and practice of prone positioning and determined the association of use of prone positioning with outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a national, multicenter observational study, performed at 22 intensive care units in the Netherlands. Invasively ventilated patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 often have an indication for prone positioning. PEEP was only different on day 2 and day 3; PaO2 was different on day 0 and day 1 (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figures S1-S8).Mortality at day 28 was lowest in patients with no indication for prone positioning:28.6% vs. 31.3% in patients that were not placed in prone position vs. patients that were placed in the prone position.
