The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor used by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses to attach to cells via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of their viral spike protein. We have used this information to guide the computational modelling and design of orthosteric peptides to target the RBD using PiPreD. We have therefore leveraged on the existing structural information available on the interaction between RBD and ACE2 to model and design peptides targeting two relevant interactions for the complex: (1) the interaction between RBD and ACE2 both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2; and (2) the interaction between ACE2 monomers. Peptides targeting the ACE2 dimerization interface also presented conformations absent in the native interface.
