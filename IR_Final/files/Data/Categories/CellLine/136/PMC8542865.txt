The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in late 2019 has spread globally, causing a pandemic of respiratory illness designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Blood profiling performed on admission and again immediately prior to death showed elevated D-dimer levels for 7 of 10 patients consistent with vascular coagulopathy (Supplementary Table 2). 286 genes were identified as significantly upregulated and 20 genes were significantly downregulated in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 patients compared with non-virally infected controls (figure 4, Supplementary Tables 6, 7).
