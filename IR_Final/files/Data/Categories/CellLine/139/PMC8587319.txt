The fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic, calling for fast and accurate assays to allow infection diagnosis and prevention of transmission. The results cover the bioinformatic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome to design the MBs, structural characterization of the MBs, evaluation and optimization of the MBs using SARS-CoV-2 RNA extracts from 426 COVID-19 patients versus 32 controls, and a scalable fluorimetric analysis for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2.The SARS-CoV-2 reference genome sequence was obtained from the NCBI virus database ( accessed on 2 April 2020) under the accession code NC_045512. The work's novelty is the design and optimization of MBs to detect the G4 regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
