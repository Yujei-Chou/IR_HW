The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. There appears to be an increase in diabetes incidence in patients who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. While an association of diabetes in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is well established, recent evidence suggests heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common comorbidity of diabetes, with a prevalence of almost 45%.
