Nuclear transport and vesicle trafficking are key cellular functions involved in the pathogenesis of RNA viruses. Interestingly, RHOA with KPNA7 (r = 0.140, p < 0.01) and CDC42 with KPNA5 (r = 0.474, p < 0.001) showed positive correlations compared with no significant correlations in non-COVID-19 patients. As shown in Figure 6, exposure for 24 h to an IVM concentration of 0.2 muM caused a similar decrease in importin alpha nuclear accumulation compared to a high IVM concentration of 2.5 muM for 1 h, reducing nuclear to cytoplasmic importin alpha distribution by nearly 20% in both Hela (Figure 6A) and Vero (Figure 6B) cell lines (p < 0.05; p < 0.0001, respectively).As importin alpha is involved in the nuclear transport of different cargo proteins, we additionally evaluated the functional impact of low concentration IVM on the cellular distribution of one of its reported cargo proteins.
