The 22nd annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2021, open-bio.org/events/bosc-2021/) was held online as a track of the 2021 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology / European Conference on Computational Biology (ISMB/ECCB) conference. ISMB/ECCB 2021 was hosted by the Showcare event service, which provides an integrated platform with a layer over Zoom. This year, perhaps due to Zoom fatigue and platform limitations, there were only a handful of BoFs, but the six BOSC-related BoFs fostered some lively dialog (see Figure 9).New Methods of Programmatic, Web, and Cloud Data Access from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)JBrowseJalview and FriendsNext steps for computational reproducibility toward fully executable papersInteroperability Challenges for Sensitive Biomedical DataThe BoF topics this year were:  After BOSC/ISMB, which concluded with an online "happy hour" ( Figure 10), there was a two-day CollaborationFest (CoFest).
