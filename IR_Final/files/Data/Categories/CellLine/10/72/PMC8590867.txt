Background
Since its outbreak, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly, with a sharp rise in the accumulative number of infections worldwide. Subgroups showed no statistically significant differences in the prevention of hospital admissions, ICU admissions and COVID-19-related death (subgroup difference P values were 0.991, 0.414, and 0.851, respectively).In the fully vaccinated groups (over 14 days after the second dose), the pooled VE was 85% (95% CI: 80-91%) for the prevention of Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 54% (95% CI: 35-74%) for the Gamma variant, and 74% (95% CI: 62-85%) for the Delta variant. In the sensitivity analyses, VE for SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic COVID-19 and COVID-19-related death got relatively lower when omitting over a single dose group of Maria et al.
