The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a huge public health crisis for the globe. Results from IFA and western blotting showed that 12C10 was a cross-reactive antibody against both of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Results from conservative and structural analysis showed that 350VYAWN354 was a highly conserved epitope and exposed on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, whereas 473YQAGSTP479 located in the receptor binding motif (RBM) was variable among different SARS-CoV-2 strains. Overall, four linear B-cell epitope peptides of SARS-CoV-2 (R345, R405, R450 and R465) were screened utilizing sera from animals vaccinated with RBD-based antigens and strong responses to three linear B-cell epitope peptides (R345, R405 and R465) were observed.
