Introduction: It is well-established that clinical pharmacist-managed anticoagulation services achieve superior anticoagulation control, with a positive impact. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the mandatory curfew, 75.9% of the sample did their coagulation profile testing at KAMC. The current study results, using the tele-pharmacy anticoagulation clinic model, are comparable with literature reporting reasonable control with dedicated anticoagulation clinics with a mean TTR 63% (95% CI 58-68%).A pooled analysis of 95 AF studies reported that only 56% (95% CI, 53-59%) of the measured INRs were in the therapeutic range, and the patients were 61% (95% CI, 59-62%) of the time in TTR.
