Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors that may lead to a more sinister disease. Zhang and colleagues found that CA was able to exert anti-inflammatory effects in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mice, showing a significantly suppressed secretion of IL-6 and TNFalpha and colonic infiltration of CD3+ T cells, CD177+ neutrophils, and F4/80+ macrophages through the activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. The researchers noted a significant reduction in body weight and fat accumulation, increases in energy expenditure and beneficial gut bacteria (i.e., Muribaculaceae), and a decrease in pathogenic bacteriae (i.e., Lachnospiraceae).
