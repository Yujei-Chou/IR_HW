The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may present with a broad range of clinical manifestations, from no or mild symptoms to severe disease. A further study from three Chinese hospitals suggested that high serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels at admission represents an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 in NAFLD/MAFLD patients. It is conceivable that COVID-19 may further increase production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in NAFLD/MAFLD subjects, with consequent activation of the coagulation cascade and thrombosis.
