We herein describe rapid and accurate clinical testing for COVID-19 by nicking and extension chain reaction system-based amplification (NESBA), an ultrasensitive version of NASBA. We first validated the feasibility of the NESBA by conducting the reactions for E and N genes of SARS-CoV-2 gRNA and monitoring the real-time fluorescent signals produced from gene-specific MBs binding to the amplified RNA amplicon under various combinations of key reaction components (Fig. Furthermore, the LOD of the NESBA reaction is lower than those of qRT-PCR and other isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques (Table S2).The specificity of the NESBA reaction was next assessed by examining the time-dependent fluorescent signals produced by other types of human coronavirus strains such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU-1, and HCoV-OC43.As shown in Fig.
