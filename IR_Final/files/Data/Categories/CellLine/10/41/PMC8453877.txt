The SARS-CoV2 mediated Covid-19 pandemic has impacted humankind at an unprecedented scale. As expected, intra-population variations existed and the occurrence of each of the (SARS-CoV2 associated) MHC-I and MHC-II alleles were not found to be uniform among the samples constituting the ethnic groups (Supplementary Table 3). 4.To evaluate any possible effect of mutation occurring/accumulating in the SARS-CoV2 genome over-time on immune recognition of the virus among different ethnicities, the mean epitope recognition potential for each individual belonging to an ethnic group was calculated with epitopes predicted from the first 10,000 and last 10,000 SARS-CoV2 genomes arranged in the chronological order of their collection dates (Fig.
