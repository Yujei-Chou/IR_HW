This study aimed to examine the awareness and status of cancer patients and healthcare providers (physicians, nurses and social workers) regarding community linkage, in order to establish a desirable care plan model in a future research project. A study on a community-based cancer patient setup conducted in Canada noted that it is important to identify patients' unfulfilled needs (financial resources, connectivity services, etc.) The highest experience rate of linking patients to the community was reported by social workers (n = 218, 69.7%), followed by oncology physicians (n = 59, 28.1%), nurses (n = 38, 19.0%), and patients (n = 49, 15.9%).According to Table 3, community connection status also differed across the three healthcare provider groups.
