Aim: To investigate the association between the experience of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and neurodevelopment of 6-month-old and 1-year-old children and explore the differences in the association by birth order. The associations between the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., the year 2020 vs. 2015-2019) and the risk of neurodevelopmental delay at age 6 months and 1 year were examined using log-binomial regression (for the outcomes with a prevalence >=15%, e.g., developmental delay in the gross motor and the communication domains at age 1 year, shown as relative risk [RR]) and logistic regression (for all other outcomes, shown as odds ratio [OR]), respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the risk of neurodevelopmental delay in infants during the COVID-19 pandemic.
