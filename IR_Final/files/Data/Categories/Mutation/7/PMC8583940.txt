Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has received global attention due to the serious threat it poses to public health. In our study, molecules that presented QPlogHERG values below -5 (2 = -5.14; 4 = -5.53 and 5 = -6.48) required greater attention and further in vitro analysis should be done to validate their pharmacological safety in the treatment against COVID-19.We noted that all programs correctly identified the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site (Figure 2A-C) and additionally indicated that this site was druggable, e.g., with a druggability probability of >0.5 in PockDrug as well as a strong primary hot spot with >=16 probes clusters and hot spots connected with a center-to-center distance of <8 A in FTMap. These data correlated with the Mpro crystallographic structure, where active site residues were well solved in the electron density maps from 2.1 A resolution.
