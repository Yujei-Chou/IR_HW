Coronavirus protease nsp5 (Mpro, 3CLpro) remains a primary target for coronavirus therapeutics due to its indispensable and conserved role in the proteolytic processing of the viral replicase polyproteins. The high specificity and consistency in cleavage site recognition among known coronaviruses has made the enzymatic active site of nsp5 the primary target for current inhibitor design efforts (Fig. used a high-throughput assay to test several non-covalent nsp5 inhibitors and identified several with an IC50 of >100 microM and showed that ML-188 [also called 16-(R)] had an EC50 between 12.9+-0.7 and 13.4+-1.0 microM. Subsequently, this group then screened additional compounds and performed SAR studies to improve the efficacy of the compounds toward the SARS-CoV nsp5 protease.
