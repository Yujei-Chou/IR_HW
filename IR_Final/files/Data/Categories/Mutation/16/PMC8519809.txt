Current coronavirus (CoV) vaccines primarily target immunodominant epitopes in the S1 subunit, which are poorly conserved and susceptible to escape mutations, thus threatening vaccine efficacy. However, stem-specific binding antibodies were sub-neutralizing as MERS SS.V1-immunized mice had significantly reduced homotypic pseudovirus neutralizing antibody responses (geometric mean reciprocal ID50 titer, GMT = 185) as compared to mice receiving MERS S-2P (GMT = 5,758), similar to BALB/cJ mice in Figure 2F. In fact, only 5 out of 20 MERS SS.V1-immunized 288/330+/+ mice had detectable neutralizing antibody responses (Figure 3C).Following challenge, 4 weeks post-boost, mice immunized with either MERS S-2P or MERS SS.V1 demonstrated no weight loss throughout the course of infection. The faster (nearly 100-fold) dissociation rate of Fab22 for HexaPro (and SARS-CoV S-2P) than that for MERS-CoV S-2P provides an explanation for the undetectable heterotypic neutralizing activity by IgG22 (and IgG72).
