The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) pandemic is a great threat to human society and now is still spreading. Our results first showed that the RBD-Fc vaccine could induce both humoral and cellular immune responses and might be an optional strategy to control COVID-19. The following are available online at , Figure S1: The epitopes with high immunogenicity on the RBD, Figure S2: The immunogenicity of RBD vaccine, Figure S3: The expression of IL-2 in the recombinant RBD and S1 subunit vaccines-immunized mice, Figure S4: Representative images of haematoxylin and eosin stained lungs and kidneys isolated from the RBD-hFc, RBD-mFc and S1-hFc fusion vaccines immunized mice at 12 weeks post vaccination.
