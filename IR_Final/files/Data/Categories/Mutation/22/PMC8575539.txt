In order to investigate the effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown on air quality in cities in southwest China, a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS) and other online equipments were used to measure the air pollution in Chengdu, one of the megacities in this area, before and during the lockdown period. The average mass spectra of Dust particles in this study were characterized by intense ion peaks of soil dust tracer, i.e., 40[Ca]+. Similar to PM2.5, the potential source areas of K-SO4 particles were distributed mainly in the areas to the northeast and southeast of Chengdu and the junction area of Sichuan province and Chongqing, showing obvious regional transmission characteristics, but the intensity of its WPSCF was far weaker than for PM2.5.
