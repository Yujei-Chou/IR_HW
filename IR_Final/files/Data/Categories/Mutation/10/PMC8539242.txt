Background: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was isolated for the first time in Saudi Arabia from a patient suffering from atypical pneumonia. A variety of the DPP4 point mutations are showing high prevalence in the Saudi population. In the exonic region, SNPs 2:162,929,979 and 2:162.930,725 were correlated to the L8 amino acid in the DPP4 protein and exon 1 of the DPP4 gene, respectively.
