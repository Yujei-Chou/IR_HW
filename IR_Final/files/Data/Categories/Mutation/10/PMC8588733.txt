This paper presents a new hybrid compartmental model for studying the COVID-19 epidemic evolution in Italy since the beginning of the vaccination campaign started on 2020/12/27 and shows forecasts of the epidemic evolution in Italy in the first six months. Concerning the starting value E 0 of the exposed compartment which is not available from data, we propose a heuristic procedure by relating it with the delay time t d between the contact with the infectious agent and the onset of symptoms of infection (see paragraph 3.2 for more details).The starting value of susceptible S 0 is the difference between the total population N and the sum of all the other compartments at time t 0.The results presented in this section have been obtained by implementing the SEIRDV_pwl and SEIRDV_pwe algorithms in Matlab 2021a. Since it us known that the vaccine efficacy is not complete, we propose here a preliminary experiment extending the SEIRDV model in (4) as suggested in.
