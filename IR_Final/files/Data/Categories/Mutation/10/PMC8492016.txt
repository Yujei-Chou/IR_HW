The SARS-CoV-2 virus like many other viruses has transformed in a continual manner to give rise to new variants by means of mutations commonly through substitutions and indels. To identify the regions of high entropy that can possibly be associated with harmful mutations, we use a running mean (window length = 15, step size = 1), here the first positional index of the window gets assigned the value of the running mean. In this work, we used K means clustering to group the different mutations based on similarities in properties.
