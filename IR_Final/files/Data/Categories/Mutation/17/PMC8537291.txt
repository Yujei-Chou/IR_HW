The cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients is not yet clear. The percentage of patients with detectable T cell immunity was reduced to 21-55% of the controls, depending on the spike antigen employed for stimulation (S1: 27 vs. 80%; S1/S2: 29 vs. 66%; S Sino: 12 vs. 56%; spike (T-SPOT.COVID): 29 vs. 54%).Spearman correlation analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in patients after two vaccinations correlated significantly with their T cell activities as determined by ELISpot responses, especially after stimulation with the peptide mix S1 (r = 0.45, p < 0.0001) and with the spike peptides of T-SPOT.COVID (r = 0.52, p = 0.04) (Table 2). However, T cell responses were similar in patients and in control persons after resolved infection.
