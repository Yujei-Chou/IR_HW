COVID-19 is a new communicable disease with a widespread outbreak that affects all populations worldwide triggering a rush of scientific interest in coronavirus research globally. H-bonding and other noncovalent interactions at approximately 2.5 A from the ligand or residue were generated from the Structural Analysis Tool in AutoDock Vina. The aforementioned results from other investigators illustrated that docking scores obtained in our molecular modeling experiments are comparable, and can be used as the initial screening tool for potential drug therapeutics for COVID-19.Several hydrogen bonding interactions were observed between spike protein and ACE2 at the interface: Asp30(A)-Lys417(E), Gly354(A)-Gly502(E) and Glu37(A)-Tyr505(E).
