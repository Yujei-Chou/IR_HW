To understand the origin of variants and their evolutionary history in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, time-scaled phylogenetic and gene variation analyses were performed. Regarding the individual genes, 11 variations in ORF1ab, 5 in S, 2 in ORF3a, 1 in ORF8, 5 in N, and 1 in ORF10 were observed, whereas no variations were observed in five genes (E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF7b).On analysing evolutionary patterns using a phylogenetic tree (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S1) and a variation table (Supplementary Table S5), Group A was the ancestor group of all 349 isolates, and it likely evolved from two Chinese isolates (A1), isolated on December 24 (EPI_ISL_402123) and 26 (EPI_ISL_406798). In group B4, 7 isolates from Europe and America containing both variants, b-(1) and b-(3), were clustered to the GISAID-V type, which was later found by July 2020.
