The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic as of March 2020, creating a global crisis and claiming millions of lives. To halt the pandemic and alleviate its impact on society, economy, and public health, the development of vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 was a dire need. Further, although viral vector vaccines are generally considered less robust than traditional vaccine types, the fact that they persist as genetic material in the host, directly infect antigen-presenting cells, and possess a strong inherent adjuvant activity triggering innate and adaptive immune responses and generating high titers of nAbs, could suffice a single vaccine dose for adequate immunization as in the case of the vesicular-stomatitis virus -(VSV)-based Ervebo vaccine against Ebola virus.
