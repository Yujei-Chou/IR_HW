Coronavirus disease 19, or COVID-19, is an infection associated with an unprecedented worldwide pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has led to more than 215 million infected people and more than 4.5 million deaths worldwide. The interaction pattern of engineered hACE2 with the RBD is similar to wild-type hACE2, extending a hydrophobic pocket and adding a new H-bond (K35 - Q493, from hACE2 and RBD, respectively), shortening the distance between hACE2 alpha1-helix to the RBD by ~1A. The use of recombinant hACE2 instead of Abs has an important advantage, given that the resulting mutants with escape mutations have decreased binding affinity to both the engineered and wild-type hACE2, leading to a decrease in virulence. However, they give an important insight into the major conformational changes to the entire protein and into critical steps culminating in cell fusion and infection.
