The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) requires adequate coverage of vaccine protection. We then assessed the breadth of post-vaccination binding antibody responses to WA1 and VOCs B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant RBD antigens, measured by biolayer interferometry (Fig. Recombinant hACE2 protein (30 mug/ml) was then allowed to bind for 120 s. Percent inhibition (PI) of hACE2 binding to the RBD by serum was determined using the equation: PI = 100 - ((hACE2 binding in the presence of mouse serum/hACE2 binding in the absence of mouse serum) x 100).SARS-CoV-2 S-expressing expi293F cells were generated by transfection with linearized plasmid (pcDNA3.1) encoding codon-optimized full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein matching the amino acid sequence of the IL-CDC-IL1/2020 isolate (GenBank ACC# MN988713), the B.1.1.7 isolate, or the B.1.351 isolate.
