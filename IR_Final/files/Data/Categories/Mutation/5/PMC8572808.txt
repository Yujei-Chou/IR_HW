Introduction: As of June 7, 2021, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to more than 200 countries. So far the COVID-19 prevention measures proposed by the Japan Olympic Committee (JOC) include the following aspects:Keep a minimum of two meters from athletes at all times. According to the current prevention and control measures of JOC, the parameters of the average number of infected class contact with susceptible class (r1), average number of infected class contact with exposed class (r2), initial asymptomatic infected population [A(0)] were adjusted, and the specific settings are shown in Table 3.As can be seen from Figure 4, based on the measures currently proposed by JOC, it was assumed that the screening before take-off can reduce 20 and 40% of asymptomatic infectors, respectively, but the prevention and control effect was not ideal.
