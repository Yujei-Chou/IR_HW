Hospitals are increasingly challenged by nosocomial infection (NI) outbreaks during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In order to prevent the spread of infection, Hospital A suspended outpatient services and new admissions in wards with COVID-19 suspected patients from Day -2. On the other hand, the number of newly infected staff peaked on Day 32 and newly infected patients peaked on Day 41.In the sixth floor ward, the number of patients with fever became noticeable around one week before Day 0 (one patient on Day -6, two patients on Day -4, one patient on Day -2, six patients on Day-1, and six patients on Day 0).
