The COVID-19 global pandemic has had severe, unpredictable and synchronous impacts on all levels of perishable food supply chains (PFSC), across multiple sectors and spatial scales. Loss of jobs was significantly correlated with the farming strategy and was significantly, negatively correlated with the presence of IMTA (mixed ANOVA test, factor "farming strategy" df = 3, p < 0.001; factor "IMTA" df = 1, p = 0.96; "Interaction farming strategy / IMTA" df = 3, p < 0.05). Financial sustainability is essential for stakeholders of the FSC and has been reported among the top risk mitigating strategies for PFSC.Following definitions of the fundamental trade-off between FSCs efficiency and resilience by, evidence from our global assessment confirmed that aquaculture PFSC - at the surveyed shock stage of the COVID-19 pandemic - failed to maintain the three elements to achieve resilience: agility (i.e., ability to respond rapidly), visibility (i.e., ability to see "end to end" in the pipeline) and increasing velocity (i.e., time/distance reduction).
