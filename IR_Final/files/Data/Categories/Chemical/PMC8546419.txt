Assessing and ranking private health insurance companies provides insurance agencies, insurance customers, and authorities with a reliable instrument for the insurance decision-making process. The outcomes yielded ten insurance companies ranking in terms of healthcare services in the era of COVID-19. Through the above analysis as well as sensitivity and validation tests, we can indicate that the proposed IF-MARCOS methodology has the following advantages: (1) It not only takes the imprecise information into account but also deals with different importance of decision-makers; (2) With different criteria weights, we can obtain various ranking outcomes and the most acceptable alternative; and (3) Because the criteria weights are determined as per the opinions of experts, firms can improve their evaluation process through the proposed IF-MARCOS approach.
