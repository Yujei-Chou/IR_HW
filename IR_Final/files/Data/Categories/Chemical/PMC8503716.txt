Background
Note: the numbers in curly brackets in this protocol refer to SPIRIT checklist item numbers. Ninety-day mortality 45% in the control group, and 40% in the intervention group (i.e., relative reduction 11%)Mean +- standard deviation (SD) VFD at day 60 28 +- 16.5 in the control group and 34.5 +- 13 in the intervention groupThe sample size was computed through data simulations based on the following hypotheses: The expected mortality in patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS is between 34 and 50%. With VT <= 4.2 mL kg-1 (i.e., 4 + 5% to account for measurement error) at least 50% of the days between inclusion and weaning of deep sedation or day 14 whichever comes first, in the intervention groupWith 5.4 <= VT <= 6.6 mL kg-1 at least 50% of the days between inclusion and weaning of deep sedation or day 14 whichever comes first, in the control groupA per-protocol secondary analysis will be carried out.
