The aim of the work was to develop and validate the COVID-19 Risk Perception Scale (CoRP), a brief self-report questionnaire for individuals' perceptions of risk in the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to test for internal consistency, we calculated the corrected correlation between the score of the item and the total scale. Regarding the discriminating validity, the CoRP correlated positively but very moderately with the Impact of Event (r = 0.37, p = 0.000).A convenience sample of 1061 (76.2% female), ranging in age between 18 and 80 years (mean age = 37.30 years old, SD = 14.13) and living in Italy, participated in Study 2.
