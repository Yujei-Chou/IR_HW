Background: A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-induced pneumonia (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in China, spreading worldwide. Consistent with the above data, when examining the distribution across the four groups, the negative correlation between T-subset pro-inflammatory compartment and the modulatory lymphocyte compartment in relation to age range and sex profile was significant, with a clear predominance of males prevalent in both PP and NP groups (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9; Table 1).The results were also statistically significant and revealed a sort of homogeneity of the data (St.dev.95%; p = 0.01) confirming the flow cytometry outcomes. Why were BALF tests positive and RT-PCR tests negative?We are aware of the limitations of the current study.
