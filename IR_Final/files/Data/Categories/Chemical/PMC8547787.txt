In critically ill COVID-19 patients, the risk of long-term neurological consequences is just beginning to be appreciated. Comparison of the Nfl levels and log Nfl levels between the 2 ICU groups and the control were analyzed with Welches't-test with significance determined at a p value < .05. The log Nfl levels in COVID-pos patients were positively correlated with the composite CVD Score (Figure 2E), (r = 0.34, p = .001, Pearson) suggesting that the Nfl levels in these COVID-pos patients are related to the level of CVD.To determine if the levels of Nfl were related to the presence of neurocx, we compared Nfl levels in COVID-pos ICU patients in those that had at least one reported neurocx to those that had none.
