A Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) study was conducted at the end of May 2021 engaging 1456 healthcare workers (HCWs) from 20 hospitals throughout Greece. In addition, correctly responding to questions related to knowledge of COVID-19 vaccination (Q22: 90.3%, PR = 1.33), having no concerns about safety of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (90.8%, PR = 1.49) and belief in mandatory vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 for healthcare professionals (95.6%, PR = 1.56) were all factors identified as associated with acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. This decision increased vaccination coverage of HCWs and protection against COVID-19.
