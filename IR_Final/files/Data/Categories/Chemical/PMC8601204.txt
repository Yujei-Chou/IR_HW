It is enlightening to determine the discrepancies and potential reasons for the degree of impact from the COVID-19 control measures on air quality as well as the associated health and economic impacts. The COVID-19 prevention and control measures had significant impacts on the PM2.5 concentrations in 20 of the selected 46 countries (Fig. Our findings suggest that the reductions of emissions potentially outweighed the enhancement in the formation of secondary aerosols in the developing countries during the COVID-19 lockdown, while the enhancement was comparable to the reduction in those of the developed countries; The increase in PM2.5 concentration in the Czech Republic, Austria, and Germany could be attributed to the enhanced secondary processing outweighing the decrease in primary emissions during the COVID-19 control period.
