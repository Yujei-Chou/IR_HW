Among the plethora of debilitating neurological disorders of COVID-19 syndrome in survivors, the scope of SARS-CoV-2-induced dysautonomia (DNS) is yet to be understood, though the implications are enormous. Sympathetic over-activation in Covid-19 is correlated with increase in capillary pulmonary leakage, alveolar damage, and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, activation of NRP-1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection might be a potential mechanism of sympathetic storm in COVID-19.It has been suggested that NRP-1 may enhance entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain through olfactory neurons with subsequent development of neurological dysfunctions including seizure, confusion, stroke and autonomic dysfunction.
