The median OR for receipt of antivirals was 4.88 (95% CI, 1.28-18.39), representing the median increase in odds of receiving antivirals when being treated at a "high antiviral use" hospital compared with a "low antiviral use" hospital. Similarly, there was no significant difference in risk-adjusted mortality during the mid-late pandemic between the 28 hospitals in cluster 1 and 4 hospitals in cluster 2 (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.05-2.06).In this large, observational, international study, we identified extensive variation in the use of medications repurposed for management of COVID-19 over the first year of the pandemic, particularly during the initial months of the pandemic, with less variation and more uniform evidenced-based practice in the later pandemic stage.
