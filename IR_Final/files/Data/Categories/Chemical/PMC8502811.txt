In this paper, we examine whether relational mobility (RM) (the ability for individuals to voluntarily form and terminate relationships within a given social environment) on a country level related to individuals' tendencies to restrict their movement following the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic and following the issuance of stay-at-home orders in their country. We show that individuals in countries with higher RM tended to decrease their geographic mobility more than those in countries with lower RM following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis revealed a significant interaction between cases per 100k and RM (estimate = -5.06, p < 0.001), such that individuals from societies higher in RM decreased their geographic mobility to a greater degree than individuals from countries lower in RM (Figure 3), particularly when case levels were high (Table 5).Next, we sought to establish temporal precedence in the observed relationship between geographic mobility and increasing case levels through a series of time lagged analyses.
