Currently, the world is witnessing the pandemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The cytokine and chemokine profiles in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with different clinical manifestations remain unclear. Our study patients exhibited increased levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, which got normalized during the recovery phase with the activation of the CTL response (our unpublished data).Comparison of the immunological profiles of children with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection indicated that those with symptomatic infection had higher IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma levels.
