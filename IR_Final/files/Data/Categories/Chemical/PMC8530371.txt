In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, the University of Kansas Center for Telemedicine & Telehealth (KUCTT) adopted a multipronged, digital strategy to address COVID-induced, high-volume telehealth inquiries in Kansas and sought to quickly disseminate rapidly evolving federal policy updates and foundational telehealth implementation guidance. Retrospectively, KUCTT examined participant engagement in three educational approaches (e.g., telehealth webinars, Project ECHO, brief instructional/informational videos) that were developed and delivered in real time to meet the specific and unique needs of healthcare administrators and providers due to the COVID-19-forced surge in telehealth utilization. The needs assessment found that the learning collaborative was interested and invested in learning strategies for maintaining telehealth lines of service beyond the COVID-19 PHE.
