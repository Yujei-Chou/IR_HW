Many Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) clinics implemented alternatives to in-person service delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including virtual visits and electronic document sharing. Among the 13 participants who reported their children were no longer receiving WIC, reasons for discontinuation of WIC participation included: not needing WIC anymore (n = 3), not being able to reach WIC due to pandemic-related site closures (n = 1), not feeling comfortable sharing personal information over the phone or by text/email (n = 2), no longer qualifying for WIC (n = 3), and moving to a new area or out of state (n = 2).Slightly over one-third of participants (36%, n = 63) recalled providing documentation of income and address to WIC since March 2020, when WIC sites physically closed. 85% of study participants reported they were satisfied with their experiences with WIC during the pandemic and most thought the quality of services was the same or better.
