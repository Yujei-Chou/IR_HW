Details on single alterations prevalence and comparisons between baseline and follow-up are reported in Table 3.The semi-automatic analysis revealed that MAD significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients from 97.5 +- 10.9 microm at baseline to 92.2 +- 11.4 microm at 6 months follow-up (p < 0.0001). An example of a comparison between fundus photos collected at baseline and 6 months later showing reduction in retinal veins diameter in a COVID-19 patient is reported in Fig.
