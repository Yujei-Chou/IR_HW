UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has updated its Managing COVID-19 rapid guidelines to include recommendations on the use of monoclonal antibodies for patients with COVID-19 in hospital. The recommendations suggest offering a combination of casirivimab and imdevimab [Ronapreve, REGEN-COV, or REGEN-COV2; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals] to hospitalised COVID-19 patients aged >=12 years. Patients must be seronegative (no existing levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their system), otherwise there will be no benefit of the treatment.
