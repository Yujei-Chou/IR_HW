Objective
Measures to control the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) pandemic have caused a public mental health crisis, wherein rigorous social distancing, followed by depletion of social support and interpersonal communication, has led to worsened depression, fear, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms. Among the respondents, we selected 1929 general participants who had not contracted COVID-19 or undergone quarantine. Meanwhile, men with prior "mild" depression showed the highest likelihood of having severe anxiety (OR 11.72, 95% CI 1.99-69.21), exhibiting a reverse U-shape pattern, whereas both women without depressive symptom and those with the most severe pre-exiting depression showed elevated ORs for severe anxiety (OR 2.64, 95% CI 2.16-3.32; OR = 3.48, 95% CI 1.32-9.17).Infectious disease epidemics have been found to affect social mental health; these include the SARS outbreak in 2013, Ebola in 2014, and MERS in 2015.
