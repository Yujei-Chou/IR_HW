In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines Office Rapid Reaction Group (GORRG) defined priority groups to guide the prioritization of surgery for nonmetastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We found significant differences in all primary outcomes across the low-, intermediate-, and high-priority groups, including (1) the proportion of patients with benign histology (21.6% vs 15.9% vs 6.4%; p < 0.001), (2) the proportion with non-organ-confined disease (5.0% vs 19.0% vs 45.4%; p < 0.001), and (3) the median Leibovich score for ccRCC (0 vs 2 vs 4; p < 0.001) as well as the proportion of patients with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk ccRCC (Table 1). The EAU GORRG priority groups were independent predictors of all outcomes of interest on multivariable analysis (Supplementary Table 2).
