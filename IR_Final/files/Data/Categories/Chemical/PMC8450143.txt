We performed a systematic sampling and analysis of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different hospital areas to assess viral spread. As shown in Table 2 , the differences between these two groups of samples was significant when comparing both the means (p < 0.01; t-test) and the medians (p < 0.05; Tukey test).The frequencies of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the air of the corridor of the ICU rooms with COVID-19 patients or in the corridors with rooms for care of non COVID-19 patients were much lower, 30% and 50%, respectively, than those from the previously described hospital areas. Previous studies of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospital areas have found a wide diversity of results, encompassing no positive samples, a very small number of positive samples or RNA levels or various positive samples (; Jiang et al.,
