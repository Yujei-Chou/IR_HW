Neutrophils provide a critical line of defense in immune responses to various pathogens, inflicting self-damage upon transition to a hyperactivated, procoagulant state. Among relevant chemokines, IL-8 mRNA showed the strongest increase in neutrophils, with no elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-1alpha, and an increase in IL-1beta mRNA that did not reach the same extent as IL-8 mRNA in neutrophils (Supplemental Figure 2D).To compare COVID-19 to non-COVID-19 pneumonic patients rather than healthy controls, we additionally made use of a recently published scRNA-Seq data set by Wauters and colleagues, which included a high count of captured neutrophils in the dataset (Figure 3, A and B). A total of 5 mug peptide/sample was assigned to channels 1-12.
