Graphical abstract
The novel and deadly Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the noxious pathogen "Sars-Cov-2", is a serious threat to global health, due to its ability to mutate and adapt to different hosts (intermediate, collateral, alternate or primary), their environment and body system, combined with the ability to subdue or bypass the complex network of human immune system or defense mechanism(s) (Etaware, 2020a), resulting in a fleet of new waves of COVID-19 infection around the world. The structured prototype system for COVID-19 infection detection "Etaware-CDT-2020" was shown in Fig 4 a and b. R2 = 5.17%VIF (beta26) = 1.67 and T = 0.60 (VIF (beta26) < 5, "X26" functions independently with other variables)The collinearity of the data generated by Etaware-CDT-2020 with that obtained from rRT-PCR was tested using the formula:r =  x = data generated by Etaware-CDT-2020y = data obtained from the corresponding rRT-PCR fileThe collinearity test showed that there was a positive relationship between the COVID-19 diagnosis conducted by Etaware-CDT-2020 and those reported by Hui et al.,
