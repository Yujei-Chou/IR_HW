The COVID-19 pandemic has led to heroic achievements in vaccine development targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Multiple cohorts have now been examined, and a recent study evaluating the efficiency of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with hematological malignancies found that patients who were actively receiving BTKIs, ruxolitinib, venetoclax or anti-CD20 antibody therapies mounted a blunt vaccine-immune response, were unprotected from the SARS-CoV-2 infection and could still develop severe and critical disease. showed that COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell response was substantially reduced in patients with solid tumors receiving active cytotoxic chemotherapy compared with individuals not on immunosuppressive therapy.
