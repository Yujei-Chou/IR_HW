Rapid, point-of-care (POC) diagnostics are essential to mitigate the impacts of current (and future) epidemics; however, current methods for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) require complicated laboratory tests that are generally conducted off-site and require substantial time. Since mCas13 showed a high activity at 37  C (Figure S3D), a temperature also optimal for T7 RNA polymerase, we attempted to couple the T7-mediated transcription of the RT-LAMP product with the Cas13-based detection of the transcribed RNA in a single tube. To establish RT-LAMP coupled with T7-mCas13-based detection and LoD range, control synthetic SARS-CoV-2 viral genomic sequences used in Figure 2 were ordered as synthetic RNA from Twist Bioscience (cat. #
