The COVID-19 pandemic is an unanticipated and uncontrollable chronic stressor that is detrimental to the mental and behavioral health of children and families, particularly those from disadvantaged and marginalized backgrounds. Further, the protections required to safeguard against COVID-19 infection also block access to activities and social relationships that are known to reduce the effects of stress (Gruber et al., The importance of this understanding is three-fold: 1) both children's and adult caregivers' brains may be affected by the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, placing them at increased risk for poor mental health outcomes, 2) pandemic-related stressors may impair caregivers' ability to provide sensitive caregiving and buffer chronic stress for their child, and 3) impairments in caregiving may be exacerbated among caregivers with a prior history of stress and adversity.
