The ongoing Chinese Color Nest Project (CCNP) was established to create normative charts for brain structure and function across the human lifespan, and link age-related changes in brain imaging measures to psychological assessments of behavior, cognition, and emotion using an accelerated longitudinal design. However, we designed questionnaires to collect data on children's learning and daily life during COVID-19 pandemic (see Table 6). Using the devCCNP-SWU baseline brain imaging data from 84 participants, we previously reported that children exhibited similar region-specific asymmetry of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as in adults, and further revealed that dACC functional connectivity with default, frontoparietal and visual networks showed a region-specific asymmetry.
