Background/Aims
The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted not only the health of people but also the learning experience of medical trainees worldwide. In the United States, this invitation was emailed to all GI and advanced endoscopy fellowship PDs, accounting for 260 invitations. PDs were more likely to report hospital or division policy as the cause for limiting the performance of endoscopic procedures by trainees compared with other faculties (66.15% vs. 47.4%, p=0.01; Supplementary Material 4).On multivariate analysis, the geographical distribution of training centers in various WHO regions was strongly associated with a negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on endoscopy training (odd ratio=6.4 and 95% confidence interval=1.83-22.33, p=0.004).
