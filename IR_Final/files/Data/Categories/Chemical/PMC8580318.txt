Unique circulating regulatory T cell phenotypes distinguish hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2. Data from the APC panel revealed eight distinct phenotypes with significant differences in cell frequency when comparing SARS-CoV-2 (all severity levels) to flu and RSV (Fig. Unexpectedly, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 patients with the most critical disease presented with unique alterations in the Treg compartment, including an increase in a population of CD45RA-CCR7+Ki67+HLA-DR+ Tregs within the circulation compared to patients with flu or RSV, and an increase in CXCR3+ Tregs in the blood of patients with COVID-19, thus leading us to predict that Treg-targeting therapies could be useful in limiting disease associated with SARS-CoV-2.
