Research on the effectiveness and applicability of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) via videoconference is sparse. However, the therapists' general work experience and EMDR experience were not of relevance (see Table 4).Linear post hoc contrasts replicated that eye movements enabled to reduce the SUD significantly stronger than tapping (23.8%, pHolm<0.001), while there was no difference between eye movements and combined eye movements and tapping (pHolm=0.166) and tapping and combined eye movements and tapping (pHolm=0.649).Therapists most frequently reported that unstable internet connection either on patient or therapist side to be a barrier to implement eEMDR (37.5%). Especially the high SUD decrease in eEMDR sessions, an important indicator of treatment outcome was very promising.
