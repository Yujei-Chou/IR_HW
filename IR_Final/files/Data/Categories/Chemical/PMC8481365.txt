Objective: A considerable part of COVID-19 patients were found to be re-positive in the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test after discharge. Until now, as far as we are concerned, no researches have investigated the feasibility and performance of the radiomics strategy for the discrimination of the re-positive cases among the recovered COVID-19 patients after discharge. The results showed that 12 factors were determined as the optimal factors, as shown in Figure 3A, and achieved the best prediction performance, with the accuracy and AUC of 49.0 and 0.505, respectively, as shown in Figure 3B.We further selected the optimal features from the significant radiomics features and all the clinical factors, aiming to evaluate the performance of combining the radiomics features with the clinical factors for the prediction task.
