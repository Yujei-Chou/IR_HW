SARS-CoV-2 triggered a worldwide pandemic disease, COVID-19, for which an effective treatment has not yet been settled. Before continuing to the next section, use the command: Advanced visualization analyses of biomolecular structures often require the functionality to select individual or group of atoms. Processing these files is easily done using the grep command available in any Linux command line (egrep "A" 6Y2G.pdb   egrep ATOM > protein.pdb ; egrep "A" 6Y2G.pdb   egrep O6K > ligand.pdb).Start ADTools GUI and several action tabs will be available to set up, run, and analyze the ADT4 and VINA docking calculations (Ligand, Flexible Residues, Grid, Docking, Run, and Analyze).Prepare the ligand by selecting the tab Ligand   Input   Open, and then navigate into the folder where the ligand.pdb file was previously saved.
