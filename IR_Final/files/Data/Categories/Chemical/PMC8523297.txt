To the Editor:The recent article by Hagin et al reports that most patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) generate humoral and cellular immune responses to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. In Fig E2 of Hagin et al (available in the Online Repository at www.jacionline.org), the gating strategy to identify RBD-specific IgG+ and IgA+ B cells and the percentage thereof are shown. RBD+ cells are a fraction of the MBCs generated by vaccination.
