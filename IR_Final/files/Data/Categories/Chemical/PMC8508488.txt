The current study assessed performance of the new Veterans Affairs (VA) women cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk score in predicting women veterans' 60-day CVD event risk using VA COVID-19 shared cohort data. These results suggest a need to assess women's short term CVD risk during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The VA women CVD risk score at the reference time point was significantly higher in those who subsequently had CVD events in the following 60 days (mean 24% with standard deviation of 24.8%) than those who did not (mean 13% with standard deviation of 18%).Figure 1 showed that CVD risk score alone discriminated patients with CVD events within 60 days from those who did not with accuracy (Area Under the Curve) of 78%, 50%, and 74% for White, African American, and Hispanic women veterans, respectively.
