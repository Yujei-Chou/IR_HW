This longitudinal analysis compares the prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with psoriatic arthritis in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the change in the prescription frequency of GCs remained significant after multiple testing adjustments (critical padj = 0.01). PHQ-2 frequency analysis showed that the majority of the patients in our sample had a PHQ-2 sum score <= 2, which is below the cutpoint for an indication of depressive symptoms at both time points (T1: n = 74, 83.15%; T2: n = 76, 85.39%).
