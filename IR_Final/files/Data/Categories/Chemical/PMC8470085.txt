The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic to symptomatic with mild or moderate presentation and severe disease. We identified 621 genetic variants that were significantly distinct between asymptomatic and acutely symptomatic COVID-19 patients (multiple-testing corrected p-value < 0.001). Interestingly, we found a clinal variation in the ancestry proportions of the symptomatic individuals, such that patients with mild and moderate symptoms depicted WHG (22.5% and 23.5%, respectively) and ANE (28.7% and 27.9%, respectively) ancestry fractions intermediate between the asymptomatic individuals and acutely ill COVID-19 patients (Table 2).To assess the robustness of these results, we further modelled these Europeans as a combination of three source populations, namely WHGs, EHGs and Neolithic Iranians, as performed previously.
