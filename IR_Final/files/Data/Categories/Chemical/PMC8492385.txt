This paper develops a numerical two-level explicit approach for solving a mathematical model for the spread of Covid-19 pandemic with that includes the undetected infectious cases. To develop the second-level of the desired algorithm, we should integrate both sides of system (12) at the node points  and . 13), (22), (23), (25), (28) allow to get a simplified expression of .To provide a full description of the two-level explicit formulation for solving the mathematical problem (1)-(5) to predicting the spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2, we should put together relations (42), (45) and the initial condition given by Eq.
