At present, the global COVID-19 epidemic is still in a state of anxiety, and increasing the cure rate of critically ill patients is an important means to defeat the virus. Patients with severe COVID-19 also have clinical symptoms of disseminated intravascular coagulation with elevated serum D-dimer and prolonged prothrombin times. In a study on the effects of inflammatory factors released by COVID-19 on cell death, it was confirmed that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), two inflammatory factors that were significantly elevated at the end of the inflammatory response, can induce PANoptosis, a regulated and extensive inflammatory cell death mode, and provide a molecular scaffold for the interaction and activation of mechanisms necessary for pyrolysis, apoptosis and necrosis.
