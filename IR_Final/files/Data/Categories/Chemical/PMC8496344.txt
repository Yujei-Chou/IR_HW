In this issue of Blood,  examine humoral responses in vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and COVID-19 to determine whether these illnesses are immunologically distinct or represent a disease continuum. COVID-19 is a viral infection, whereas VITT is not. Using samples from VITT and COVID-19 cohorts and affinity-purified anti-PF4 antibodies from patients with VITT, they conducted structural experiments and immunoassays and used clinical data to show that VITT is indeed its own immunologically distinct syndrome and is not related to COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 protective immunity.
