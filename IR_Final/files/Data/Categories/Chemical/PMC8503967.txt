The onset of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic prompted unique public health measures including stay-at-home (SAH) orders that provoked altered dietary and exercise patterns and may have affected medication access and use. Further, there were large variances within the sample which skewed toward increases during SAH - 55% of the cohort exhibited increases in nonHDL-C during SAH relative to 2019 (Fig.- top).Simple linear regression analyses found that younger age, a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, pre-SAH treatment with lipid-lowering agent(s), female sex, non-White race, and Hispanic ethnicity were predictive of increases in nonHDL-C during SAH. Finally, we determined odds for experiencing >=38 mg/dL increase in nonHDL-C during SAH vs 2019 using white males as the reference group.
