With a few exceptions [eg, patients with both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infections, compared with patients with SARS-CoV-2 but without HIV infection, less often had exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from nursing homes (1.5% versus 8%) but were more likely to report abdominal pain (44.8% versus 35.1%) or chest pain (53.2% versus 42.4%)], self-reported risk factors and presenting symptoms were similar across the strata.
