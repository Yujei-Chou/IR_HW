Objectives: To explore and understand the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of convalescents, the association between antibody levels and demographic factors, and the seroepidemiology of convalescents of COVID-19 till March 2021. A descriptive analysis of the 517 convalescents with SARS-CoV-2 infections was detailed in Tables 1, 2. Convalescents aged 40-59 years were less likely to be IgG seronegative than those aged below 20 years [OR = 0.364, 95% CI: (0.138, 0.959), P = 0.041].The analysis of the 1,707 serological samples showed that the total positive rate of IgG was higher than that of IgM during the whole study time, and the immune response persistence of IgG was longer than that of IgM antibody, which was consistent with the current research.
