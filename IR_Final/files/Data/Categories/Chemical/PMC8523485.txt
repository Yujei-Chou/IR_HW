Anti-viral monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments may provide immediate but short-term immunity from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in high-risk populations, such as people with diabetes and the elderly; however, data on their efficacy in these populations are limited. Post-mAb infusion, all animals exhibited robust neutralizing activity in sera with neutralizing titer (NT50: reciprocal dilution of sera required to inhibit viral replication by 50%) >10,000 at day of inoculation (range: 12,738-56,374) with a gradual decay from day 0 to day 7 (range: 4,198-24,977) (Figure 1B).Clinical signs of infection were generally mild and did not require intervention (Figure S1A). vRNA was detected within the left caudal lobe in one of four animals in the RBD mAb group compared with three of four control animals.
