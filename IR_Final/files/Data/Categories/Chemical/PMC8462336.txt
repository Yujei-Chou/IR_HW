The serial interval and effective reproduction number for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are heterogenous, varying by demographic characteristics, region, and period. We estimated probabilities of transmission between any pairs of case-patients in an outbreak by using a transmission probability matrix method (Appendix Supplemental Material B). Although the number of reported cases was lower in first wave, Rt was much higher in the first wave ( 3.5) than in the second wave ( 1.7).Although the general pattern of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was similar across all counties, the dates of local maximums/minimum (i.e., first peak, local minimum, and second peak) and the magnitude of Rt at these extremes varied among counties.
