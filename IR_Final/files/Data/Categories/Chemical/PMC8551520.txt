Background
During the past decade, there has been the rapid development and adoption of online learning in medical education. Although most of the students had good scores for this course (N = 249, 88.6%), there was no association between the good score and the course attendance (COR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.40-1.75), time spent in the course (COR = 1.55; 95% CI = 0.61-3.91), or frequency of the course's logins (COR = 1.51; 95% CI = 0.73-3.13).Among the participants, 60% were males and 26.7% had previous experience in online learning. Furthermore, this study paid attention to the LMS infrastructure, which the data from LMIC were still insufficient.
