Countries with quick access to COVID-19 vaccines, like those in Europe and North America, are hoping that the vaccination programmes would prevent the spread of the Delta variant. The disparity between high-income and low- and middle-income countries when it comes to vaccine access and availability cannot be overlooked any longer.
