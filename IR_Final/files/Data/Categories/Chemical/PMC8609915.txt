Early and accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza viruses at the point-of-care is crucial for reducing disease transmission during the current pandemic and future flu seasons. For more accurate results, different dilutions were made between 6 and 0.03 TCID50/muL.We determined the detection specificities of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A H1N1 virus assays by carrying out the following experiments: (a) we used the primer set for SARS-CoV-2 detection to test the genomic RNAs of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A H1N1, and CoV-OC43, respectively, to confirm if it would not produce nonspecific amplification for the latter two, and (b) we used the primer set for influenza A H1N1 virus detection to test these three virus RNAs. Note that the 2-GE LoD was obtained from samples containing RNA that is equivalent to the corresponding virus genome.
