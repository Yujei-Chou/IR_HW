Abstract
Regular menstrual cycle is an indicator of the normally functioning hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and a vital sign of women's health and well-being. Previous studies showed that menstrual cycle characteristics are closely linked with future reproductivity. A large prospective study with 391 320 participants found decreased fecundability ratios in women with longer cycle length, both shorter and longer bleeding duration.
