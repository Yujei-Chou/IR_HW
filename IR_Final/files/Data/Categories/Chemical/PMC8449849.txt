Objectives
The study uses nationwide hospital surveillance data, and includes all general hospitals in Belgium. Similarly, but outside of the hospital setting, studies with data from general practitioners in England, found a strong association of ACEIs/ARBs' use and a reduced risk of COVID-19 disease (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.67) although not severity (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.25), and marked interactions with ethnicity with higher risks observed for black African patients compared with white patients. Similarly, a study conducted in 347 patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in Paris (France) analysing the association between in-hospital exposure of ACEIs/ARBs and mortality within 30 days of hospital admission using logistic regression analysis, no association (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.48) based on chronic exposure but a protective association (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.65) based on in-hospital exposure was observed.
