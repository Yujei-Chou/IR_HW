During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. conservative politicians and the media downplayed the risk of both contracting COVID-19 and the effectiveness of recommended health behaviors. In the U.S. sample, the timing of participants' completion of the baseline survey was not associated with political orientation (r = .01); within the non-U.S. sample, there was a small association of political orientation and enrollment in baseline study (r = .11).Being a large-scale project covering a broad-range of psychological factors (for a full codebook of all questions included in the manuscript, see: https://osf.io/qhyue/), effect sizes for the research questions examined in this paper were not estimated a priori. 18) P34 "Our studies show that messages from leaders and media outlets..." again this is overstates the results.
