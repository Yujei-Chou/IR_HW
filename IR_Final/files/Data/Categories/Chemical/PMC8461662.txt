Sleep disturbances are among the common nonmotor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A supplementary meta-analysis showed that PD with RBD was characterized by a decreased apnea index and increased PLM index and REM sleep. The significance of CPAP therapy for OSA has been highlighted by several studies: one study described associations among the narcoleptic phenotype, SOREMP on MSLT, and the presence of sleep-disordered breathing in 46 patients with advanced PD, and another prospective study that included 38 PD patients with a mean disease duration of 5.3 years showed that CPAP treatment improved OSA and daytime sleepiness measured by MSLT (baseline, MSL 8.7 min; 3 weeks, 11.3 min).
