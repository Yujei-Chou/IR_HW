Objective
Individuals with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (RDs) are considered to be at increased risk for infection because of their underlying condition or exposure to immunosuppressive drugs. D'Silva et al used a multi-institutional electronic health record data set to report on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with RD compared with the general population and found that patients with RD with COVID-19 were at higher risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, acute renal failure, and venous thromboembolism compared with matched controls, although differences attenuated for all of these outcomes, except venous thromboembolism, when comorbidities and medications were accounted for. Patients with RD were more likely to be female (22.0% vs. 11.2%), more likely to have had prior inpatient admissions (mean [SD] 0.45 [0.99] vs. 0.22 [0.74] for controls), and more likely to have nearly every comorbid condition listed (Table 1).
