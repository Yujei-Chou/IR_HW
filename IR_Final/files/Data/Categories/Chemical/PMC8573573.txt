The coronavirus disease named COVID-19 (previously known as "2019 novel coronavirus") by the World Health Organization on 11 February 2020 is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). According to WHO recommendations, the cost of PPE to care for COVID-19 patients without AGMPs, (face mask type II + water repellent gown + goggles + gloves for COVID-19 care unit) increased from 1.481 in January to 2.063 euros in July 2020; with AGMPs (respirator + water repellent gown + apron + goggles + gloves for COVID-19 care unit), it was multiplied by more than a factor of two, growing from 1.600 in January to 3.333 euros in July 2020.We report the results on management of the donations received by the University Hospital of Poitiers during the COVID-19 health crisis.
