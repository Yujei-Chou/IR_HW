Our goal was to assess agility, explosive power, and speed-endurance capacity by implementing noninvasive procedures and sport-specific tests. In contrast, session "B" was performed in even weeks and included four plyometric jumps to improve reactive strength. We conducted the 60 m CT to assess the agility of the participants (n = 11).
