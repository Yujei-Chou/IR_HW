Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, national and international authorities started to develop and update datasets to provide data to researchers, journalists and health care providers as well as public opinion. Despite the complexity of accessing the several files available, the French website provides a substantial set of additional variables that can be helpful for integrating COVID-19 data, such as the analytical capacity of diagnostic tests, the epidemic spread of COVID-19 variants (i.e., Alpha formerly called UK Variant; Beta formerly called South Africa Variant; Gamma formerly called Brazil Variant; and Delta formerly called India Variant) and access to the emergency room by gender, age group, region and department. The second perspective focuses on the type of variables to establish whether information can be compared at the international level.
