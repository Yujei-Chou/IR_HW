Introduction
Identifying the appropriate patient groups who will benefit most from shielding (strict social distancing/isolation) during the COVID-19 pandemic is important for children as the mental health sequel of shielding are not inconsequential. The remaining patients did not use rituximab for various reasons: concerns due to increased risk of immunosuppression (n = 9), lacking the need to use rituximab (n = 6) and disruption in the availability of rituximab (n = 1).Four hundred and thirty-six children received 701 doses of Rituximab (SDNS = 80%; n = 347, SRNS = 14%; n = 59; and unknown = 7%; n = 30) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a previous international survey of COVID-19 infection among 113 children with kidney disease receiving various immunosuppressants, only 11 (10%) received rituximab.
