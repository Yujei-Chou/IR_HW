Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multisystem disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that primarily causes respiratory symptoms. Acral ischemia manifests as necrosis with localization in fingers and toes. Maculopapular-erythematous eruptions (Figure 8) have the highest prevalence (40-70%) of the cutaneous manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2, including (a) erythematous eruptions 38.5%, (b) maculopapular eruptions 18.3%, (c) macular erythema 6.8%, and (d) papulo-squamous eruption (2%) (Figure 9).Maculopapular-erythematous rashes have been identified in elderly patients and with a localization mainly on the trunk or in a generalized manner, and without significant differences between sexes.
