The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the development of several risk factors for mental health, not only for people directly infected but also for those experiencing social isolation, loneliness, and concern for their health. On the basis of this analysis, the present study aims to explore (a) what is the relationship between the coping strategies used during a stressful event, such as the COVID-19 widespread, and the anxiety symptoms measured taking into account four independent planes of the Self proposed by the Functional Therapy approach (cognitive-symbolic, emotional, physiological, and muscular) and (b) whether psychotherapy moderates the relationship between the multidimensional anxiety symptoms and coping strategies. The independent variable and predictors were introduced in step 1, the interaction between psychotherapy and coping strategies in step 2.
