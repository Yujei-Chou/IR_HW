COVID-19 has caused 100s of millions of infections and millions of deaths worldwide, overwhelming health and economic capacities in many countries and at multiple scales. This phenomenon might explain, for example, why initial policy development, such as prolonged closing of schools and work places, appeared to be justified on expectations of direct benefits on human health (Quah,) rather than on equally important, but more abstract and indirect effects, such as the potential of these policies to increase the rates of domestic violence (Bradbury-Jones & Isham,), murder (Fuller & Arango,), and suicide among young people (Sher,).Several design lessons emerge from treating COVID-19 as a super wicked problem. Hence, it is critical that future anticipatory policy deliberations designed to avoid, rather than repeat, mistakes made during COVID-19 incorporate scholarship on trust and legitimacy.
