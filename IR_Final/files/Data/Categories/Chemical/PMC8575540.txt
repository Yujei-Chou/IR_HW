As of September 17th, 2021, the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases continues to increase, with 226,236,577 confirmed cases, 4,654,548 deaths, and 204,397,158 recovered individuals across 185 countries and regions. In this trial, all participants and researchers involved in drug distribution, outcome evaluation, and data analysis were blinded to the allocation. As BFHX was associated with better attenuation of COVID-19 manifestations on chest CT than placebo in the convalescent period, our findings suggest that BFHX promotes the absorption of lung lesions and prevents deterioration of pneumonia following COVID-19 infection.
