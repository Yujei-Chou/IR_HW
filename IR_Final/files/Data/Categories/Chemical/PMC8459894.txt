Incarcerated populations have experienced disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19-related illness and death compared with the general U.S. population, due in part to congregate living environments that can facilitate rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and the high prevalence of underlying medical conditions associated with severe COVID-19. Among incarcerated persons, those aged >=65 years and those with underlying medical conditions associated with severe COVID-19 were the first to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Among fully vaccinated persons without a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, the attack rate was higher among Pfizer-BioNTech recipients (99 of 117; 85%) than among Moderna recipients (19 of 35; 54%) (p<0.001).Among 172 infected persons, four (2%) were hospitalized for COVID-19, including three (8%) of 39 unvaccinated patients, and one (1%) of 129 fully vaccinated patients (p = 0.04).
