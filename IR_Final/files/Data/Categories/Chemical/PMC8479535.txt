Molecular testing sensitivity, which allows for early diagnosis of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), could be affected by sample quality, storage, and transportation timeframe to the laboratory, along with bias related to the pre-analytic phase. Most of them originated from collection centers for COVID-19 diagnosis (86.6%), while 10.9% and 2.5% were from RRT and TIDS, respectively (Figure 1 ).The trend of sample quality indicators showed an increase in the proportion of compliant samples from June to November 2020 (Figure 2 ).Of the 174,085 samples received, 92.2% were found to be adequate (compliant) for the COVID-19 diagnosis test, while 7.0% had minor errors but were accepted for testing. The analysis of results obtained using this strategy could allow us to indicate how the reorganization of sample reception was imperative in May 2020.
