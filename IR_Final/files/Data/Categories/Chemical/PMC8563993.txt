Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global health crisis affecting over 200 countries worldwide. Patients who were unresponsive to conventional ARDS rescuing therapies were eligible for ECMO support if they met the following clinical criteria: (1) developed a refractory severe ARDS; (2) Lung Injury Murray Score >= 3;(3) developed uncompensated hypercapnia with pH <7.25 or PaCO2 > 60 mmHg over 6 h; (4) PaO2/FiO2 < 80 over 6 h; (5) PaO2/FiO2 <50 mm Hg over 3 h. Patients with refractory severe multiorgan failure and/or significant neurological injury were excluded. Liver damage was seen in all the patients infected with COVID-19, as evidenced by elevated levels of ALT and total bilirubin.
