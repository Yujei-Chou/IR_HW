We use the full administrative records from four leading agricultural economics journals to study the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on manuscript submission, editorial desk rejection and reviewer acceptance rates, and time to editorial decision. The  coefficient estimate indicates the differential association of COVID-19 lockdowns with the hazard rate for first editorial decision for manuscripts sent for review - i.e., those subject to prospective delays affecting both editors and reviewers - as compared to submissions not sent to review. The association between COVID-19 lockdowns and the hazard rate for first editorial decision for manuscripts sent for review is given by the sum .In order to allow for time to decision effects that might vary with the gender of reviewers - in case COVID-19 lockdowns had a gender-differentiated effect on reviewing speed - we estimate a less restricted survival model considering the subsample of submissions sent out for review.
