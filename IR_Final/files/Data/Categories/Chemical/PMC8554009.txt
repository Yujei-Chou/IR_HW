We present the case of an acute onset ANCA positive vasculitis in an asymptomatic COVID-19 infected teenager, resulting in significant colonic damage. The patient was initially diagnosed with Henoch-Schonlein purpura and presented with worsening symptoms with significant necrosis of her perineum and rectum requiring surgical debridement and diverting colostomy.
