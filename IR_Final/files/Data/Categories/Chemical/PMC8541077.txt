Background: In December 2020, the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines arrived in Romania and were made available to medical and social staff. The variables that were significantly associated with reporting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance after logistic regression were: living in an urban area (Ora = 1.58, 95% CI: 0.98-2.56), being female (Ora = 1.59; 95% CI:1.03-2.44), and being a medical doctor (Ora = 3.40; 95% CI: 1.84-6.26). The difference was statistically significant: 305 (87.89%) women vs. 42 (12.10%) men out of the 347 responders that presented adverse reactions (p = 0.037).Because the questionnaire was distributed in the early days of the vaccination campaign in Romania and some participants had not had the opportunity to be immunized, while some were immunized with only one COVID-19 vaccine dose (227), we addressed the question, "If you have not been vaccinated yet or have not completed the vaccination scheme, would you like to be vaccinated later when possible?".
