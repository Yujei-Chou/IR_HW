Background: Current global challenges are generating extensive social disruption and uncertainty that have the potential to undermine the mental health, wellbeing, and futures of young people. The process will employ a systems perspective to examine the primary local drivers of youth mental health and suicide challenges in each region. To answer research question (i), differences in projected (cumulative) numbers of key mental health outcomes such as self-harm hospitalisations and suicide deaths between a non-COVID-19 baseline (i.e., had the pandemic not occurred) and COVID-19 baseline scenario will be calculated for each set of parameter values, summarised using simple descriptive statistics, and compared across the eight sites to determine whether pre-pandemic regional variations in youth metal health outcomes are likely to be exacerbated as a result of COVID-19.
