Based on the information-as-coping perspective, we provided a theoretical framework to understand how the quality of government information and citizens' partisanship impact citizens' wellbeing in terms of satisfaction with life and anxiety during COVID-19. 3 further illustrates the moderating effects of perceived finance risks on the relationship between information overload and anxiety. Our statistics show that although partisanship is not significantly related to perceived information quality, i.e., people from different partisanship do not hold negative evaluations for government information quality, it exerts a negative impact by contributing to information overload, possibly by selectively exposing to more information.
