In this SARS-COV2-pandemic, diabetes mellitus (DM) soon emerged as one of the most prominent risk factors for a severe course of corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and increased mortality due to hyperglycemia/insulin resistance, obesity, inflammation, altered immune status, and cardiovascular complications. Thus, more studies are needed to clarify whether and which sex differences exist in predictors of mortality in COVID-19 amongst patients with DM.In addition, the use of different types of antidiabetic medication such as SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 analoga, lipid lowering, antihypertensive, and anticoagulant treatments should be investigated regarding the potential sex differences in COVID-19 mortality or adverse events. Greater knowledge on immune response and potential adverse effects to COVID-19 vaccinations in the especially vulnerable group of pregnant DM would be needed.
