Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with specific coagulopathy that frequently occurs during the different phases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can result in thrombotic complications and/or death. From our anecdotal experience in patient with COVID-19 infection and left internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion was eptifibatide bolus administration effective in prompt recanalization of ICA (for more details see Figure 4 ).In a retrospective cohort that included 152 patients with COVID-19 in Germany, antiplatelet monotherapy (mostly acetylsalicylic acid) showed no benefit. However, in a randomized control trial (RCT) that included 246 patients moderately ill with COVID-19, TCZ did not effectively prevent intubation or death.
