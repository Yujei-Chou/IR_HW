The long-term impact of COVID-19 on transplant recipients remains unknown. The IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum specimens were detected using YHLO-CLIA-IgG and YHLO-CLIA-IgM kits supplied by YHLO (YHLO Biotech Co. Ltd Shenzhen, China) and interpreted with >= 1.2 AU/mL indicating as a reactive (positive) test and < 1.2 AU/mL as a nonreactive (negative) test. It is unlikely that this event signified re-infection or re-exposure for the following reasons: (1) serial nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained negative until month 12; (2) the patient had no clinical symptoms suggestive of re-infection; (3) His IgG titer continually decreased until M12; (4) the changes observed in levels of DCs, mDCs and B-cells showed a trend consistent with IgM levels.
