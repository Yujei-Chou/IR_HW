ABSTRACT
The ability to detect and characterize antibodies targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins in plasma has been one of the most informative tools during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, average CPM for each SARS-CoV-2 peptide across the 22 individuals strongly correlated between sample types (Pearson R = 0.87) (Fig. Our study and prior reports demonstrate strong agreement between paired plasma and DBS for single-epitope SARS-CoV-2 binding assays, such as the commonly used RBD ELISA.
