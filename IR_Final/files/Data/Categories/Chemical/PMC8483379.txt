In the context of epidemiology, policies for disease control are often devised through a mixture of intuition and brute-force, whereby the set of logically conceivable policies is narrowed down to a small family described by a few parameters, following which linearization or grid search is used to identify the optimal policy within the set. In the second discretization method, the disease control policy is continuously parametrized through the vector mu = (t1, t2, ..., t2N), and lockdown is assumed to take place within the time intervals [t1, t2], [t3, t4], .... In this parametrization, lockdowns can be declared or lifted at arbitrary times within [t0, tf], and not only on Mondays, like in the first heuristic. Repeating the optimization for , Fig 11, we see that the critical care capacity is rarely surpassed.
