A 76 year-old female came to our observation one week after the vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222 for the onset of purpuric rash on her gluteal and legs regions associated with coxalgia and episodes of macrohaematuria. reported a case of reactivation of IgA vasculitis occurring after COVID-19 vaccination and suggested a possible link between the reactivation of pre-existing IgA vasculitis observed after vaccination and the increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgA. IgA vasculitis flares are reported following vaccinations and patients with IgA nephropathy show a stronger IgA response to intramuscular influenza vaccine respect to healthy controls. Several rare but serious adverse reactions have been reported in the post marketing surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines.
