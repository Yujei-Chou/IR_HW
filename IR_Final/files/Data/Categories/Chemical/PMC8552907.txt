Abstract
The ongoing global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Wu et al,). Some membrane proteins that are known as receptors or regulators of other coronaviruses, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (receptor of hCoV-EMC) (Raj et al,), aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) (receptor of coronavirus TGEV) (Delmas et al,), and interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM1 and IFITM3) (Huang, Bailey, et al,; Shi et al,), may not directly bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, but can enhance viral entry (Fig 1A) (Li et al,).We aimed to identify host proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2 proteins systematically using both AP-MS and BioID-MS. Ligand binding to such pockets can induce conformational changes that affect interactions with other protein interaction partners of the target (Dauch et al,; Rudalska et al,).
