Background
Patients with chronic pain conditions may have impaired deep breathing. Participants were also taught abdominal muscle strengthening exercises to improve fitness and improve the ability to clear secretions. To prevent decompensation, individuals should practice routine pulmonary exercise training with the goal of achieving increased maximal inspiratory mouth pressure for sex, height, and weight, an increased lung volume expiration, and increased cough capacity.
