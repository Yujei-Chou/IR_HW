A continuum of COVID-19 and the integration of biomarkers that inform diagnostic platforms, prophypaxis or treatment strategies, with a goal of optimal patient care
The Food and Drug Administration defines a biomarker as a laboratory measure or a physical sign that is used in therapeutic trials as a substitute for a clinically meaningful endpoint that is a direct measure of how a patient feels, functions, or survives, and is expected to predict the effect of the therapy. In 1998, the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Definitions Working Group added a dimension to this definition, and included that a biomarker is: "a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention". Each review included in this issue of the Journal of Thrombosis and Thrombolysis represents the contribution of each member of the ICODE group working collaboratively during an unprecedented time in human history.
