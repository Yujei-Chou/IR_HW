Viral epidemics have negative, and in some cases, extreme impacts on psychological well-being, particularly in health care workers. "When asked about what they were most worried about since the outbreak, 6 students were most worried about family and vulnerable relatives (e.g. children, grandparents); 6 were most worried about how their studies were being affected (e.g. competency, motivation); 5 were most worried about the uncertainty about 'getting back on our feet' (e.g. the economy, international security, air travel, social distancing, and job prospects); and one student was most worried about job opportunities.
