Objective
Fear, anxiety, and distress are natural human reactions to emerging infectious diseases. Moderate or severe symptoms of PTSD were frequent in all HCW subgroups: nurses (55.9%), non-clinical HCWs (50.6%), allied health (49.1%), and physicians (31.3%) (Table 2).Staff who were isolated or quarantined during the COVID-19 pandemic scored higher on all 3 metal health outcomes than those who were not required to do so (P < .001) (S1 Table). HCWs who reported that they were managing without professional mental health were less likely to experience post-traumatic stress symptoms (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.21-0.44, P<0.001), anxiety (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.17-0.34, P<0.001), and depression (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.22-0.43, P<0.001).Participants in our survey reported a high prevalence of moderate or severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression in all HCWs in the current pandemic similar to other studies examining psychological distress.
