This is the first in-depth analysis of the hospital journey of patients with intellectual disabilities compared with the general population after admission for COVID-19.We had a large sample size of 506 patients with intellectual disabilities and 1518 well-matched controls. Significantly fewer ID patients were admitted to ICU, underwent intubation or received non-invasive respiratory support compared with controls (table 3). Adjusted for age group, sex, severity of illness on admission, number of comorbidities and Down syndrome diagnosis, patients with ID were 37% less likely to receive non-invasive respiratory support, 40% less likely to receive intubation and 50% less likely to be admitted to the ICU while in hospital (figure 1).People with ID had a 56% increased risk of dying from COVID-19 after they were hospitalised compared with controls, with a mortality rate of 29.2% for the ID group compared with 18.8% for controls (online supplemental appendix figure 1).
