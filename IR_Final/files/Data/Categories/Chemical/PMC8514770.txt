Objective: Limited data are available regarding the rates and risk factors of severe to serious adverse reactions (ARs) to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. For both local and systemic ARs, being female was identified as a risk factor for developing grade 3 to grade 4 ARs (adjusted OR for local ARs = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.91-3.93; adjusted OR for systemic ARs = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.42-2.97). Regarding comorbidities, diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased risk of grade 3 to grade 4 ARs in females (adjusted OR = 5.50, 95% CI = 1.81-20.73), and any allergy other than asthma (adjusted OR = 9.73, 95% CI = 1.07-210.61) and hypertension (adjusted OR = 4.02, 95% CI = 1.15-14.50) were associated with an increased risk of grade 3 to grade 4 ARs in males (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figures 1-3).This study evaluated the rate of and risk factors associated with grade 3 to grade 4 ARs among HCWs who received their first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine.
