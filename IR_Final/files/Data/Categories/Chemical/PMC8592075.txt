Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative agent for Corona virus diasease-19 (COVID-19), which was first described late December 2019, in Wuhan, China and has since spread rapidly across the globe causing an international pandemic. Interestingly, the optimal cut-off of hs-cTnI (16.8 ng/L) to predict the primary endpoint was well below the 99th percentile of 59 ng/L.We also show that using a dual marker strategy by measuring copeptin and hs-cTnI together upon hospital admission for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection adds significant prognostic value to established risk prediction models for COVID-19. In a multivariate Cox regression model, elevated copeptin was independently associated with all-cause death in the acute coronary syndrome (HR = 1.7 (95% CI 1.3-2.3), p = 0.002) and non:acute coronary syndrome cohort (HR = 2.7 (95% CI 1.4-5.0), p = 0.0018).
