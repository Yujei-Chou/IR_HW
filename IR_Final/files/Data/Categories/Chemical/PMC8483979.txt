We report a case of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) in a young man diagnosed 13 days after Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen) vaccination. Despite negative imaging, we initiated treatment for presumptive VITT given the striking clinical picture that included the timing of his recent adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine, leg symptoms, marked thrombocytopenia, and consumptive coagulopathy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of VITT following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination presenting without radiographically-demonstrable thrombosis.
