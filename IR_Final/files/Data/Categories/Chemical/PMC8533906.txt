Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells present in virtually all tissues; they have a potent self-renewal capacity and can differentiate into multiple cell types. Interestingly, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are known to enhance the immunosuppressive properties of MSCs, in agreement with the view that these cells downmodulate ongoing inflammatory responses (Figure 2B).MSCs can also reduce the differentiation of naive CD4+ T lymphocytes into Th1 effector cells or attenuate their function by decreasing IFN-gamma production and promoting a shift towards a Th2 immune response. This possibility is reinforced by the observation that MSC-derived EVs can prevent the development of fibrosis following experimental lung injury.
