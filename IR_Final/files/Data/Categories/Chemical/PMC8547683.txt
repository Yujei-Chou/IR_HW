Background:
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is repeatedly observed in the ventilated adult patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Patients with AKI were older in the AKI group (53.1 +- 2.75 vs. 46.8 +- 1.2; P = 0.001) and they had a higher rate of hypertension (33% vs. 14.5%; P = 0.007) and they had a significantly higher CCI (1.8 +- 0.14 vs. 1.0 +- 17; P < 0.001). The survival analysis showed that the time for discharge from the ICU was significantly longer when CRRT was started regardless of the survival status at discharge; the median ICU LOS for the CRRT group was 58 days (IQR: 22-90) versus 14 days (IQR: 8-26) for patients in the no-CRRT group and 16 days (IQR: 9-24) for the no-AKI group; P < 0.001 [Table 9 and Figure 2].Not only did this study confirm the high incidence of COVID-19-associated AKI but also it demonstrated that renal involvement was progressive with a high rate of CRRT.
