The infection dynamics of COVID-19 show frequent phases in which the infection spreads rapidly, resembling explosive infection. Table 3 shows typical estimation results (1)-(6).8 Of these, we explain the following three as remarkable features: (i) the logarithm of positive PCR tests at the initial time point is negative and significant in all estimates; (ii) the inhabitable population density is positive and significant; and (iii) the predicted values for onset and severely ill patients based on the Nishiura prediction are negative and significant. As discussed in Section 2, the income convergence hypothesis states that the lower the per capita income is at the initial stage, the higher the growth rate will be.
