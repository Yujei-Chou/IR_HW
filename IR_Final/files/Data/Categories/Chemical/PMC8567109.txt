Background
Approximately 422 million people are living with diabetes around the world, with a majority of them belonging to low and middle-income countries. The majority of our participants never ran out of medicine, similar to the findings of Sankar P et al.. Most of them continued with their treatment protocols during the lockdown in contrast to the findings of Gautam V et al. This could partly be explained by the finding that the majority of patients in the present study didn't run out of medicine ever during the lockdown.
