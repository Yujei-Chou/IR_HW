Special care dentistry (SCD), one of 13 dental specialties, is the most recent addition to the GDC Speciality List, in 2008. At undergraduate level, though a listed aspect of the GDC's curriculum, experiences within special care departments are often limited. It has always stood out to me for in highlighting the importance of the person behind the dental problem, a feature which definitely makes SCD clinics among my favourites.
