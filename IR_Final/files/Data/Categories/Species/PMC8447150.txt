Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat and has been crippling health systems worldwide. The most common reason for not being willing to pay for the vaccine was "The COVID-19 vaccine should be provided freely" in both study sites with 59.1% (95% CI = 48.5%-69.2%) in Hanoi and 90.0% (95% CI = 68.3%-98.8%) in Ca Mau (p < 0.05).Regarding acceptance, pregnant women living in rural/mountainous areas (48.4%), those with high school education or below (51.6%), and those with private health insurance (31.5%) were more likely to refuse vaccination (p < 0.01, Table 2). Regarding factors associated with WTP, living in Ca Mau province [OR = 11.88, 95% CI = (2.57; 54.91)], having a child [OR = 1.83, 95% CI = (1.02; 3.3)] and perceiving themselves to be at higher risk of having COVID-19 [OR = 3.17, 95% CI = (1.23; 8.16)] or higher monthly household income [OR = 1.09, 95% CI = (1.02; 1.16)] were positively associated with WTP for COVID-19 vaccine.
