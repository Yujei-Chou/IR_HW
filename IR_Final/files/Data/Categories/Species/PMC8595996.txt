The SARS-CoV-2 virus disproportionately causes serious illness and death in older individuals. We initially assume a drug effectiveness of 90% in reducing the production rate and examine the effect of treatment initiated at different times after infection onset. Despite model limitations, this study has found differences in viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 between young and aged animals and has shown that these differences should be considered when considering antiviral treatment.
