Childhood cancer survivors are known to be at risk of chronic co-morbidities, although their risk of COVID-19 infection remains uncertain. These findings can inform counseling of survivors and clinician recommendations for this population. This was true for most, but not all subgroups examined (Table 2).Including all at-risk subjects, the overall risk of COVID-19 infection was lower among CCS than controls (1.5 vs. 1.7%; RR = 0.81 (95% CI = 0.70-0.92); Table 2) and, specifically among CCS >=30 years, >10 years since diagnosis, previously diagnosed with lymphoma, and without prior ABMT (P < 0.01; Table 2).To our knowledge, this is the largest study to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 infection among childhood cancer survivors, and the only one in which this risk is compared to matched general population controls.
