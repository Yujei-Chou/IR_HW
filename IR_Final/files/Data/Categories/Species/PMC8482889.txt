Dear Editor,
Dear Editor,With great interest, I went through the article Intracranial hypertension and visual loss following COVID-19: a case report by Ilhan B et al. The authors have very nicely described a possible association of intracranial hypertension in a COVID-19 positive, obese patient. There are reports associating intracranial hypertension and Vitamin-B12 deficiency in literature.
