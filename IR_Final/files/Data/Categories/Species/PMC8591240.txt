Background: Kidney transplant recipients appear to be at higher risk for critical COVID-19. Our analysis aimed to identify the risk factors for a severe course (hospitalization) of COVID-19 disease in a group of patients after KT and the risk factors for COVID-19 fatalities, with a focus on the parameters before the infection (not on the parameters worsening infection during its course). In our patient group, the presence of HLA-DQ2 appears to be a protective factor in the case of the need for hospitalization.
