When the International Health Regulations (IHR) came into force in 2007, WHO announced that "the global community has a new legal framework to better manage its collective defences to detect disease events and to respond to public health risks and emergencies". Inadequate compliance of states with obligations under the IHR, particularly on preparedness, contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic becoming a protracted global health emergency. WHO should further strengthen its work with relevant networks to coordinate and offer immediate technical support in outbreak investigations and risk assessments, and such offers should be accepted by states parties; where such offers are not accepted by states parties, they should promptly provide a written explanation of their position.
