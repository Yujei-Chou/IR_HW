Background: Acute respiratory viral infections can result in cardiovascular involvement, with such patients having a significantly higher mortality rate than those without cardiovascular involvement. Logistic analyses were performed to evaluate the risk factors for critical and fatal illness (Table 2). Those with four risk factors, old age (>=60 years), male sex, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, had odds ratio more than 100 of severe COVID-19 than those without these risk factors, although it should be taken into account that it can be statistically exaggerated due to relatively small numbers of patients.
