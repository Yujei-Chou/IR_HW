Background: Quarantine during the covid-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with poor psychological health in students. Hence, several studies among quarantined students report a link between precariousness and depression. Although we observe a correlation between fear of contagion on the one hand and depression and sleep disorders on the other hand, (r = .16 and .12, r2 = 0.02 and .01, respectively), regression analyses revealed no link between fear of the virus and depression or sleep disorders (beta = .02, NS).
