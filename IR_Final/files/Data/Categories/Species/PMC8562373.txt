Computer simulation has been used to identify peptides that mimic the natural target of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus spike (S) protein, the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) cell receptor. Based on modeling of the crystal structure of the ACE2 and RBD SARS-CoV-2 complex authors of found that the most significant for the entry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses into the cell was protein S RBD binding to the peptide sequence of the spike-binding peptide 1 (SBP1, Table 1); they synthesized a 23-membered SBP1 peptide and using bio-layer interferometry showed that SBP1 was tightly bound to RBD with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 47 nM (this value was comparable to that (14.7 nM) for full-length water-soluble ACE2). Chimeric peptides X1 and X2 bound to RBD with the highest affinity (dissociation constants of 1-10 muM).
