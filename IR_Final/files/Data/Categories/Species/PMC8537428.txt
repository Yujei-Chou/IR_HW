As worldwide large-scale inoculation of novel vaccines is on the way, the importance of real-world data on safety cannot be overemphasized. The distribution of the types of AEFIs after administration of the first and second ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine doses is illustrated in Figure 2. We reported that the incidence and severity of AEFIs after the second dose were lower than those after the first dose, which were consistent with the results of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine clinical trials, reporting that the reactogenicity profile after the second dose appeared to be less severe.
