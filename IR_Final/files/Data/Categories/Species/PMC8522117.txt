Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the ongoing global pandemic that poses substantial challenges to public health worldwide. We additionally tested the effect of 4 different small-molecule RIPK1 inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung organoids and found that all of them inhibited the viral-mediated activation of RIPK1 as indicated by diminished p-S166 RIPK1 and reduced the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 as indicated by the reduction in the levels of viral NP (Supplementary information Fig. Interestingly, treatment with RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1s was able to inhibit RIPK1 activation and reduce the level of viral replication as indicated by NP expression in the human lung organoids infected by either the 323P or 323L variants (Fig.
