The recent outbreak of respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has led to the widespread use of therapeutics, including dexamethasone (DEXA). Kenaga and Goring investigated a WWTP influent with an average glucocorticoid concentration of 42 ng/L, with 0.81 ng/L attributed to DEXA. The data reviewed herein demonstrate the occurrence of DEXA in different environmental matrices (e.g., sediments, surface water) and drinking water at variant concentrations, from <1 ng/L up to >3.7 microg/L. Remarkably, occurrence data for DEXA are too few even in regions where it has been reported (e.g., Europe and Asia), and this is expected to increase significantly in response to COVID-19.
