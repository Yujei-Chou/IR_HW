This study applied a behavioral lens to understand drivers of COVID-19 vaccination uptake among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Nigeria. While over two-thirds (69%) considered it very important to get a COVID-19 vaccination, less than one-third (32%) of HCWs found it very easy to get a COVID-19 vaccination for themselves. There was a statistically significant relationship between the motivation and ability variable and being fully vaccinated: 64% of HCWs with high motivation AND high ability had gotten two doses of a COVID-19 vaccination, compared with 35% of HCWs with low motivation AND high ability, 27% of HCWs with high motivation AND low ability, and 11% of HCWs with low motivation AND low ability (p < 0.001).Table 2 shows the adjusted odds of an HCW getting two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.
