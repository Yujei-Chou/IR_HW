We analyzed service utilization data from the National Eating Disorder Information Centre's (NEDIC) toll-free helpline/chat to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on help-seeking behaviors among youth with disordered eating and their caregivers. The number of contacts from affected youth (n = 650) and caregivers (n = 823) was significantly higher in the pandemic year than 2018 and 2019. Indeed, the number of affected youth contacting NEDIC significantly differed between years (chi2(2)=310.42, p<.001), with the highest number (n = 650; 27.5%) of affected contacts in 2020, versus n = 273 (19.6%) in 2019, and n = 201 (17.0%) in 2018 (2020>2019>2018).In the pandemic year, more than half of affected youth (n = 343) reported engaging in dieting/restriction, and 46% (n = 298) reported weight pre-occupation.
