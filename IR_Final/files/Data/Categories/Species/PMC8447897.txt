The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered movement and behaviour patterns of populations across the world. Their analyses suggest that if vaccines maintain an efficacy of 90% and 80% against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection respectively, reaching the herd immunity threshold may require more than 85% vaccine coverage in the general population. This potential correlation may confound estimates of vaccine effectiveness and disease transmissibility in countries with high community spread.
