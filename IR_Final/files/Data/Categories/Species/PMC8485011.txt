To the Editor:I read with great interest a recent article by Cheng et al that examined the contamination status of air and environmental surfaces with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in airborne infection isolation rooms occupied by single symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several studies have shown that air samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in isolation rooms with 12 air changes per hour. However, the positivity rates of air samples collected around patients who did not receive aerosol-generating procedures have been discordant, while environmental surface samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all of these studies.
