To reduce the spread of COVID-19 among the population, Belgium has implemented various infection prevention and control measures over time. Pearson's correlation coefficients between the different indicators measuring respondents' understanding were relatively low, i.e., r = 0.177 between perceived and actual understanding, r = 0.362 between perceived extent of being informed and perceived understanding, and r = 0.128 between perceived extent of being informed and actual understanding, although all were statistically significant (p < 0.001).This nationwide survey involved a representative sample of 2008 citizens of Belgium and investigated their knowledge, understanding and behaviour regarding COVID-19 measures in September 2020. This should also include actively using the communication channels that are used by the identified groups at risk of poorer understanding.
