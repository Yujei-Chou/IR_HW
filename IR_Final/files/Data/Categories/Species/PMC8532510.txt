Abstract
As of September 7, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 222 million cases and 4.5 million deaths worldwide and will continue to have far reaching impacts on healthcare systems for many years. We will include all studies of patients with COVID-19, which report readmissions to hospital after discharge from index hospitalization. Guidelines have now been drafted for COVID-19 patients' initial admission, although readmission guidelines are still lacking.
