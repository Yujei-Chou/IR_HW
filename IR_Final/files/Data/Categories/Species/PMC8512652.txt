The long-term immunity and functional recovery after SARS-CoV-2 infection have implications in preventive measures and patient quality of life. Although signal/cutoff (S/CO) ratios were lower in non-severe group, all but 1 of the results were above the positive diagnostic threshold of S/CO = 1.0, when all 100 samples of unexposed individuals, which were randomly chosen from sera of in-hospital patients who had negative results from multiple PCR and serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 before and after the date of serum collection, had S/CO values <0.05 (Fig. In this study, we define COVID-19-related symptoms as those only appeared after or shortly before the onset of COVID-19 and found about 30% participants still experiencing at least one of them at 1-year post-infection, which is in line with large surveys from Germany (34.8% prevalence at 7-month, n = 958) and Italy (40.2% at 6-month, n = 599).
