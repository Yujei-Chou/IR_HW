The recent identification and rise to dominance of the P.1 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants have brought international concern because they may confer fitness advantages. The evasion potential was also evaluated in 149 randomly-selected serum samples from healthy individuals inoculated with the BNT162b2 vaccine that were collected before vaccination, approximately 2-5 weeks (range 13-33 days, median 23 days) after the first dose, and 2-8 weeks (range 11-53 days, median 34 days) after the second dose. The inhibition potencies towards the wt RBD and the mutations were significantly correlated (rho values ranging from 0.763 to 0.945, Spearman rank p < 0.0001) ( Supplementary Figure 1 ).Next, we investigated whether the mutations could escape recognition by a panel of 18 high-affinity murine mAbs raised against wt RBD or the prefusion-stabilized spike ectodomain.
