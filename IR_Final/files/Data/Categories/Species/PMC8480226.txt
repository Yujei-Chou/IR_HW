Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has created considerable disarray in the access and provision of health services to other fields of medicine and surgery. Strategy for sample selection and data collectionExhaustive data were collected on all adult patients (>18 years) who presented to the hospital during the aforementioned timelines with a hospital admission of ischemic heart disease. These included admissions (p=0.001), STEMIs (p=0.031), NSTEMIs (p<0.001), angiography procedures (p=0.006), CABG procedures (p=0.001) and medical management (p<0.001).This retrospective study reveals three main findings: a significant overall decline in patients reporting with IHD (both ACS and elective admissions for stable CAD); a relative decrease in procedures (both diagnostic and therapeutic); and a statistically significant downward trend (month-wise) in the geographical area of presentation, time of admission and NSTEMI presentations which also correlated with Pakistan's peak surges.
