Background
This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of a digital human (DH) that delivered a psychological intervention to mitigate the effects of social restrictions on loneliness, stress, and well-being in vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapport with Bella was measured using the 20-item Friendship Questionnaire developed by Johanson et al, with items adapted to suit a DH. There were no significant differences in how much younger and older adults liked the brain and stress module (mean score 5.71, SD 1.38 vs mean score 5.43, SD 1.22; t19=-0.48; P=.63) or how helpful they found the module for improving their understanding of stress (mean score 5.43, SD 1.13 vs mean score 4.64, SD 1.78; t19=-1.06; P=.30).Of 21 participants who visited the brain and stress module, 18 (86%) reported looking at the mental health tips section afterwards to learn about stress management and mental well-being.
