I read with interest the recent publication by Bayarri-Olmos et al. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) variant investigated by Bayarri-Olmos et al., already demonstrated enhanced binding of the Y453F RBD to human ACE2 in September 2020.The author declares no conflicts of interests with the contents of this article.
