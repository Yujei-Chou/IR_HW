Throughout 2021, the medical and scientific communities have focused on managing the acute morbidity and mortality caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Initial studies demonstrated that, in both selected patients (those with COVID-19 and elevated troponin levels during hospitalization) and unselected patients (those with a range of asymptomatic, mild, moderate or severe COVID-19), a concerningly high frequency (up to 78%) of patients had abnormalities seen on cardiac MRI. The concerning results from these studies led to additional investigations with cardiac MRI in patients with a range of COVID-19 severity.
