The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 93 million cases and 2 million deaths in the world. A study that included children with COVID-19 detected SARS-CoV-2 fecal RNA in more than 91% of the cases, with viral detection in feces for up to 70 d. Data from studies evaluating the duration of positivity of stools for SARS-CoV-2 among infected individuals are shown in Table 2. Studies that evidence the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples raise attention to the risks of human exposure in the environment.
