Suicide and suicidal ideation was a significant public health concern before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the pandemic has made it even more urgent. A comparison of respondents in the analytic sample (N = 875) and those who responded to time point 1 but dropped out at time point 2 or 3, or were excluded owing to unemployment (n = 573), showed that the analytic sample was more likely to be older (>40 years), male, employed in a managerial/non-manual occupation, have higher educational attainment and have no pre-existing mental health conditions (Supplementary Table 1). The adjusted model 1 showed that younger age (adjusted odds ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.07-2.22, P = 0.021), loneliness at time point 2 (adjusted odds ratio 1.52, 95% CI 1.02-2.26, P = 0.041) and suicidal ideation at time point 2 (adjusted odds ratio 15.17, 95% CI 9.95-23.13, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with suicidal ideation at time point 3 (Table 3).
