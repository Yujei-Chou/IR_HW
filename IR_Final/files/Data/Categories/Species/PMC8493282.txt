Objectives: The spread of COVID-19 has undeniably unsettled the social, psychological and emotional life of the entire world population. Participants were categorized according to their PREQ MMSE value (>=25, 23-24, and <= 22), and the comparison of the sociodemographic and health-related characteristics between such PREQ MMSE groups was performed through the ANOVA.In order to test the hypothesis that individuals with worse cognitive performance (and their caregivers) may have been more strongly impacted by the COVID-19 quarantine, we first compared the DASS, PSS, COPE, and CBI scores (as continuous variables) between the three PREQ MMSE groups. Our results confirm the other few studies available that suggest an increase of global caregiver burden during the COVID-19.
