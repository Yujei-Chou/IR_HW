Background
Africa in general and Ethiopia, in particular, contributed very little to COVID-19 research. The remaining 88 articles were retrieved for full-text review (Figure 1). Studies conducted soon after the first reported cases have shown good level of awareness and favorable attitudes by community and HCWs towards COVID-19 and its control.
