Background
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, as a pandemic with governments worldwide implementing restrictive measures to slow the spread of the virus and prompting an international effort to develop an effective vaccine. Unvaccinated Asian or British Asian individuals had a multivariable adjusted HR of 1.45 (95% CI 1.41-1.49) of testing positive by 60 days compared to the White group (Multimedia Appendix 1). Certainly, regarding the latter, there is some evidence to support this, as a number of individuals tested positive within 5 days of attending for vaccination (Figure 4).In the care home residents or housebound individuals, the rise in positive case rate in the second week post vaccination was greater than that of the rest of the vaccinated population (55/15,742, 0.35% compared to 525/389,243, 0.13%) in non-care home and housebound individuals.
