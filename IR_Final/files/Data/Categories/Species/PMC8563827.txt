Previous research has shown that Dark Triad traits are tied to non-compliance, while there is not enough research regarding sadism. Thus, non-compliance with various COVID-19 prevention measures is related to personal tendencies for different kinds of risk taking. Second, hierarchical regression analysis was conducted with gender, age, and previous/present infection with the novel coronavirus in the 1st step as control, Dark Tetrad traits in the 2nd step, and risk-taking tendencies in the 3rd step, while compliance with protective measures was criterion in the fist analysis (hierarchical linear regression) and category regarding against getting vaccinated or unsure contrasted to these who have applied for vaccination or have been vaccinated in the second analysis (hierarchical logistic regression).
