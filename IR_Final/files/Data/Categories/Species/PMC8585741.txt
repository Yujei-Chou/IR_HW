The outbreak of COVID-19 has been affecting the daily lives of almost everyone and puts huge psychological pressure on people worldwide, including Turkey. COVID-19 danger fears was found to be the highest (M = 3.35, SD = 0.94), followed by contamination fears (M = 3.26, SD = 1.12), xenophobia related to COVID-19 (M = 2.66, SD = 1.16), compulsive checking and reassurance (M = 2.60, SD = 0.93), traumatic stress (M = 1.87, SD = 0.89), and fears of socioeconomic consequences (M = 1.80, SD = 0.92).Our study indicated that anxiety and stress are related to each other. Recent studies indicated a significant worsening in the severity of obsessive-compulsive disorders especially in terms of contamination.
