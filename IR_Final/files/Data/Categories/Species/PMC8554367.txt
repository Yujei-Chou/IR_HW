Diabetes, whether due to pancreatic beta cells insufficiency or peripheral resistance to insulin, has been suggested as a risk factor of developing severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. The latter study aimed to determine predictors of discharge from hospital and death within 28-d after hospital admission in patients with diabetes and COVID-19. Besides the effects of the inhibition of the above mentioned alternate effects of the RAS, in the context of metabolic diseases such as obesity, T2DM or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, plasmatic Ang II is positively correlated with body weight and is associated with insulin resistance, suggesting that ACE/Ang II activity is upregulated in those metabolic disorders.
