The pressing need for SARS-CoV-2 controls has led to a reassessment of strategies to identify and develop natural product inhibitors of zoonotic, highly virulent, and rapidly emerging viruses. Additionally, recent examples of MS-based ligand screening have demonstrated numerous methodologies successfully identifying NP ligands for target proteins directly from extracts and have shed light on additional potential applications.- Together, in silico molecular modeling and MS-based affinity validation can be harnessed to expedite the identification of new and promising natural products to control SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging members of the Betacoronavirus genus by targeting key proteins with significant homology across the entire genus. Resources like these provide a valuable mechanism for utilizing the wealth of historical NP characterization efforts in modern computational screening approaches.
