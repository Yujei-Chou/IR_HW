Aim: The severity of COVID-19 has raised a great public health concern evoking an urgency for developing multitargeted therapeutics. These phytoligands were prioritized for further biological experimentation because of their acceptable predicted ADME and drug-likeness parameters. Liriodendrin (Syringaresinol-di-O-glucoside) (15) exhibited hydrogen bonding with Arg403, Glu406, Arg408, Gln409 and the key Lys417 at the SARS-CoV-2-CTD side without binding to hACE2 residues (Figure 3S & T).It is worth noting that acacetin-7-O-beta-glucopyranoside (13) has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory action with well-proven efficacy against chronic obstructive pulmonary disease via inhibiting neutrophilic lung inflammation in a murine model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
