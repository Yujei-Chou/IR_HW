With a well-defined mechanism, spike nanoparticles offer an effective vaccine solution to SARS-CoV-2 variants. The I3-01v9 SApNP showed sixfold longer retention, fourfold greater presentation on follicular dendritic cell (FDC) dendrites, and fivefold higher GC reactions than the soluble spike. Mouse plasma at week 2 after a single dose was analyzed in SARS-CoV-2-pp assays, with most groups showing negligible or borderline ID50 titers (fig.
