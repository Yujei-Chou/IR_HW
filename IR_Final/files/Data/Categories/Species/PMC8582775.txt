Objectives: To analyze the role of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, to measure pharmacists' attitude toward COVID-19 safety measures (wearing masks, wearing gloves, isolation shield, good hygiene, etc.), Our survey included questions to measure the pharmacist's opinion on their role during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacist knowledge of similarities between the COVID-19 pandemic and the Spanish influenza of 1918 expressed varying significant uncertainties, as pharmacists in the 23-30 age group (p-value < 0.001), and pharmacists with bachelor's degree (p-value = 0.018) were both more uncertain of such knowledge.
