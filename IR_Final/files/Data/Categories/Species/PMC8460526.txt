Summary box
Long COVID presents with multidimensional clusters of symptoms that can fluctuate, sometimes unpredictably, whereby symptoms adversely affect general well-being and ability to perform day-to-day activities, exercise or work. Given the importance of terminology to provide clarity of understanding and communication among community and health providers, we recommend the use of the term 'episodic disability' to characterise the multidimensional, episodic and unpredictable health-related challenges associated with Long COVID.We need to establish a better understanding of the lived experiences of people living with Long COVID, in order to provide a foundation for conceptualising and defining episodic disability experienced among people living with and affected by Long COVID. There is a critical need to assess the impact of rehabilitation interventions to reduce episodic disability and enhance health outcomes for people living with Long COVID.
