In this retrospective analysis, we examine the impact of the lockdown of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on eating habits in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on a hybrid artificial pancreas (HAP). Compared to prelockdown, reported body weight tended to increase during lockdown with no changes in total energy intake. The overall consumption of animal-derived products tended to decrease (247 +- 86 vs. 315 +- 83 g/day before lockdown, p = 0.054) with no major changes in the individual main sources of protein (Figure 1B).
