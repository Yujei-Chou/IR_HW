Objectives
A couriers' job is flexible hence, the working conditions are varied and depend on the mode of employment, type of delivery, and type of employing organization. Stress had a strong correlation (beta = 0.44, p < 0.001) with musculoskeletal pains, and package weights were also correlated with musculoskeletal pains (beta = 0.18, p < 0.01).Compared to the period before March 2020, 46% of couriers indicated they worked more, 19% worked less, and 35% experienced no change during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that stress and work hour overload were correlated with road accidents through the mediation of unsafe road behaviors.
