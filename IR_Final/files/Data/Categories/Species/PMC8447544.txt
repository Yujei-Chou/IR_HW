Background
There have currently been no studies demonstrating the nosocomial Covid-19 infection rate for patients undergoing elective surgeries. If patients agreed to participate, they were then screened with a pre-operative survey to assess for symptoms or exposure to Covid-19 in the 14 days prior to their scheduled cesarean section and serum Covid-19 IgG antibody test. The primary endpoint of this trial was a positive Covid-19 PCR 6-9 days after discharge from the hospital.
