There is controversy whether IL-6 (receptor) antagonists are beneficial in treating COVID-19 patients. Based on 63 studies with 23,826 patients mortality was lower in the IL-6 group compared to the control group with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.75 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.86) and a risk difference (RD) of 7.4% (95% CI 4.4% to 10%), see Fig. When the meta-analysis was restricted to studies conducted in the ICU setting (9 studies) the risk for secondary infections was higher for patients treated with Il-6 (receptor) antagonists compared to patients not treated with IL-6 (receptor) antagonists: RR 1.26 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.82) I2 of 52%.In this systematic review and meta-analysis we re-evaluated the treatment effect of IL-6 (receptor) antagonists on mortality and possible side effects in COVID-19 patients compared to COVID-19 patients who did not receive IL-6 (receptor) antagonists.
