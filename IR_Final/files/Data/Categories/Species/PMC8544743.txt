This study investigates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival secretions and tears and evaluates ocular symptoms in a group of patients with COVID-19. Our results are in line with this hypothesis as our patients with positive ocular samples had moderate or severe disease. In conclusion, our data support the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in tears and conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19.
