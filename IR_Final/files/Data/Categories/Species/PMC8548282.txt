This paper analyses the influence that the initial actions and strategies pursued by hotel managers have on the recovery of occupancy after a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The dependent variable of our study corresponds to the expectations that managers have regarding occupancy recovery in their respective establishments. With regard to the means used to obtain information on the evolution of the infection and the mechanisms to mitigate its effects, we observe better occupancy expectations (estimations 2 to 5), improved recovery trajectories (estimations 6 and 7) and shorter times needed to restore the usual situation (estimation 8) when firms rely more on official sources and their associated networks.
