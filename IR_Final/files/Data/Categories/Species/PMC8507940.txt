Vaccines against COVID-19 are likely to be approved for children under 12 years in the near future. All other demographic characteristics of children between phases were similar (Table 1).Overall, 1736 (62.7%) caregivers planned to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, and among parents of children under 12 years of age, 1223/2003 (61.1%) planned to vaccinate their children. In phase 2, caregiver age and child's immunization status remained predictors of willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19.
