Although psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are a common neurologic condition, there remains a paucity of literature on the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on these patients. Among our cohort of 18 subjects with PNES, 22.2% reported an improvement in seizure control during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. In this cohort, 75% of subjects with improved PNES control had stress and poor sleep as one of their usual seizure triggers, opposed to 50% and 35.7%, respectively, for patients who reported stable or worsened PNES control; however, this did not reach statistical significance (Table 2).
