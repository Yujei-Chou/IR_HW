Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a major impact on almost all individuals and healthcare systems globally. Factors independently associated with more perceived stress (beta +- SE) were as follows: nurses compared to physicians (4.90 +- 1.55, p = 0.002); and other profession compared to physicians (5.91 +- 2.29, p = 0.011).In this study of pediatric hematology and oncology healthcare professionals conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that when compared the United States general populations, anxiety, depression, and positive affect scores were similar. This review found that exposure to COVID-19 was the most common factor associated with worse mental health.
