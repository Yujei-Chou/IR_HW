COVID-19 caused major changes in private and public arenas. The first part of the article explores the intensification of care activities during lockdown for women living in the Canton de Vaud in Switzerland. The authors examine to what extent these reconfigurations reproduce "gender norms defining women as caregivers - nurturing, self-sacrificing, and caring - and men as breadwinners" (, 80), as well as the implications for the management of risk and protection for both women and men.
