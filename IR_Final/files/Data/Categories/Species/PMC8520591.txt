To date, numerous studies have evaluated the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and asthma; however, the impact of asthma on COVID-19-associated outcomes remains controversial and not fully understood. The risk of death was not associated with an increased or decreased eosinophil count (Cox regression; P =.57 and P =.53 for percentage and absolute values, respectively).In a recently published study, Eggert et al reported that among patients with asthma positive for SARS-CoV-2, the allergic asthma phenotype was associated with a reduced risk of hospital admissions, meaning that certain phenotypes of asthma may be protective. However, further large cohort studies are needed to evaluate the effect of asthma severity and phenotypes on COVID-19 outcomes in older adults.
