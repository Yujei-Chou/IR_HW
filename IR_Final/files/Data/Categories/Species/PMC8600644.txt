Medical shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic saw numerous efforts to 3D print personal protective equipment and treatment supplies. This is consistent with some of the previous reports in the literature, which measured an increase in biocompatibility after curing. Finally, emission factors for the flow splitters were multiplied by a factor of 0.54 to normalize emissions to those of an oxygen enrichment port (3071:5633 mm2).Part photographs; additional emission factor plots; Vocus proton transfer time-of-flight mass spectrometer calibration information; and likely molecular identifications for mass spectral signals(PDF)The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.1c04695.#
