Dear Editor,
Dear Editor,Myopia as a global public health issue and 50% of the world's population becoming myopic by 2050 have become stronger messages for Myopia advocacy ever since the prediction was made. This study averaged the 5-year time trends to predictions for the upcoming three decades across all age groups, with an estimated prevalence of 48.14% in 2050.Given the current understanding regarding the complexity of myopia progression, how annual progression may not correlate with subsequent progression, and the increased prevalence rates affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely that these predictions are potentially underestimating the expected prevalence. This is the time for all stakeholders to bring in more unified efforts toward advocacy in bringing policy change at state and national levels.
