Background: Knowledge on the settings and activities associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is essential to inform decision-making. We included as dependent variables those related to contextual factors that could increase the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Cases and controls also reported high frequency of hand hygiene (81.5% of cases and 82.2% of controls reported to wash hands/use hand sanitiser six or more times a day).The risk of infection was 2 to 4 times higher among individuals with lower education level compared with those with tertiary education (Table 2).
