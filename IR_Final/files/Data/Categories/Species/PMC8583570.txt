During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents could not leave their house freely, meet up with friends, or attend school; previous literature showed that youths under enforced confinement or quarantine were five times more likely to suffer from psychopathological symptoms and use social networks sites (SNs) greatly. The total effect model (F (1,738) = 48.12, R2 = 0.45, p < 0.001), the mediator variable model (F (1,738) = 22.15, R2 = 0.35, p < 0.001), and the dependent variable model (F(1,738) = 34.23, R2 = 0.41, p < 0.001) were all significant after controlling for adolescents' gender and age. However, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated the links between all of these variables (the quality of parent-adolescent relationship as perceived by the adolescent, SN use, the capacity to be alone, and psychopathological symptoms) in youths during COVID-19 lockdowns.
