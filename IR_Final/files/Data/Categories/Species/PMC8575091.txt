We present a case of a 14-year-old, previously healthy female, admitted with acute coronavirus disease 2019 infection and new-onset seizures secondary to virus-associated necrotizing disseminated acute leukoencephalopathy. Physical examination was remarkable for seizure activity and fever on presentation; no focal neurologic deficits were noted. Patient's magnetic resonance imaging brain with/without contrast repeated 6 weeks after initial presentation showed complete resolution of prior findings (Figures 3 and 4).This is a rare case of pediatric COVID-19 associated case of VANDAL and only second documented pediatric case of COVID-19 associated encephalitis.
