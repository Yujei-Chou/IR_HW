Background
Healthcare providers are the frontline soldiers battling against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nyashanu et al (2020) conducted a study on the UK frontline workers providing care to COVID-19 patients and found that most of them had anxiety and fear caused by the limited time that they had to prepare for the unpredictable pandemic, and their poor preparation for such as a result. This research work focused on how healthcare workers manage to work under stress during the COVID-19 pandemic.
