Key Points
COVID-19 increases venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk. This patient received an enhanced regime of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as per NICE guidelines (NG 186) due to the increased risk of VTE in COVID-19. Unilateral spontaneous psoas haematomas have previously been described in the use of the standard prophylactic dose of LMWH.
