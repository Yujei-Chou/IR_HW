Rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals is a cornerstone for the control of virus spread. The RT-LAMP assay was performed with nucleic acid saliva extracts instead of crude saliva. Subgroup analyses were performed according to (1) the presence of symptoms on the day of testing, (2) the Ct value of the nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, expressed as low (at least one of the 3 targets with Ct <= 28, i.e. high viral shedding), or high (all 3 targets with Ct > 28, i.e. low viral shedding) and (3) the consumption of alcohol, coffee, food and smoking or tooth brushing before sample collection.
