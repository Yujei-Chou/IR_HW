Purpose: The present study investigates the impact of obesity surgery on mental health (i.e., eating behavior and distress) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further moderation analyses attempted to identify risk factors for increased COVID-19-related dysfunctional eating behavior after surgery. To further explore whether obesity surgery had an influence on the respective psychopathological dimension (PHQ-8, GAD-7), COVID-19-related fear, and dysfunctional COVID-19-related eating behavior (DCSEB), group differences (with vs. without surgery) were assessed via Mann-Whitney U tests.
