Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a life-threatening complication described after administration of recombinant adenoviral vector encoding the spike protein antigen of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2. From February 2021 independent reports detailed a life-threatening syndrome characterized by thrombosis, mainly in atypical locations, and thrombocytopenia occurring in healthy individuals within weeks from vaccination with the adenoviral-based ChAdOx1-S vaccine. In contrast to HIT, the binding of antibodies to PF4 occurred in the absence of heparin.
