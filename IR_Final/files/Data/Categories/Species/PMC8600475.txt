Abstract
The efficacy of secondary and tertiary prevention of work-related stress, anxiety and depression, including vocational rehabilitation based on Health & Safety Executive Management Standards, psychological self-help, lifestyle adjustments, medical and psychological treatment, is supported by strong evidence and included in the clinical and managerial guidelines. Our study revealed two statistically significant correlations:The 'senior' (Q2 and E2) OHDs were less likely to directly reference HSEMS than the 'junior' colleagues, andThe more qualified (Q2) OHDs were also significantly less likely to refer employees for counselling or EAP.Below the level of statistical significance, the 'junior' OHDs recommended more proactive management, in line with the guidelines, e.g. HSEMS and recommendations of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The most common intervention, OH follow-up (51% of the reports), may suggest a 'watchful waiting' approach based on the assumption that WRSAD may be self-limiting and tend to improve with time away from work and GP support.
