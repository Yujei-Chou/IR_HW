The most common hereditary disorder in adults, alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), is characterized by reduced plasma levels or the abnormal functioning of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT), a major human blood serine protease inhibitor, which is encoded by the SERine Protein INhibitor-A1 (SERPINA1) gene and produced in the liver. Moreover, the baseline AAT levels were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 (42.9 +- 12.1 vs. 65.5 +- 2.8 mg/dL; p = 0.012).Unlike previous findings, Schneider and Strnad recently assessed the association between AATD and COVID-19 in the United Kingdom Biobank, a community-based cohort with >500,000 participants, and showed that the most common and mild AATD genotypes were not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection rates or increased SARS-CoV-2 fatalities, whereas the number of severe AATD cases was too low to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn. suggested that patients with AATD should be considered to be at an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of severe COVID-19 based on the following assumptions:Shimi et al.
