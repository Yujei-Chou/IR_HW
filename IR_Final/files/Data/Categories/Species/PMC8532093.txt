The optimal timing of glucocorticoid treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is uncertain. Finally, the 16-day nucleic acid negative rate of patients with a high-risk common type COVID-19 pneumonia was markedly higher in patients treated with methylprednisolone than in those not treated. These results support the use of methylprednisolone in patients with a high-risk common type COVID-19 pneumonia.
