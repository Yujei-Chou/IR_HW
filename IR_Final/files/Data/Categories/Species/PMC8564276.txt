Over the past 6 years, acute respiratory infections have constituted an average of more than 70,000 cases in South Korea. For RSV, primers and probes were designed to target the consensus region of RSVA and RSVB matrix protein genes. Cycling conditions were reverse transcription for 5 min at 50  C, pre-denaturation for 30 s at 95  C, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation for 5 s at 95  C, and annealing and extension for 30 s at 60  C. The data analysis was performed using Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.1 (Bio-Rad) and UF300_Viewer (Genesystem) (Table 2).Additional declarations for articles in life science journals that report the results of studies involving humans and/or animals.
