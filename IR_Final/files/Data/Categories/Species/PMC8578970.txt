The prognostic role and diagnostic ability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease indicators are not elucidated, thus, the current study aimed to investigate the prognostic role and diagnostic ability of several COVID-19 disease indicators including the levels of oxygen saturation, leukocytes, lymphocytes, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and D-dimer in patients with COVID-19. A univariate Cox regression analysis was conducted on the seven indicators in the study patients using the "survival" R package. The findings of the current study established that the levels of oxygen, lymphocytes, and albumin in patients were significantly higher in the common, compared with those in the severe and critical clinical types (Figures 1A-G).
