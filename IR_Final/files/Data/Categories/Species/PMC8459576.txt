Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) surface glycoproteins deposited to the NCBI GenBank from Europe, by the mid of April 2021 (12.04.2021) were analysed. Many crystallographic structures of neutralizing antibodies in complex to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein domains (such as: N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD)) are available at Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/) and they can serve as templates to predict updates in binding affinity upon SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations. For that reason, Dictionary<string, int> was used, Fig.
