This article reports on an exploratory study comparing mental health social work (MHSW) in Europe. Again, a key dividing line was if countries had roles for mental health social workers that were formalised by legislation. On these issues, there was a striking similarity in the respondents' views.to strengthen effective leadership and governance for mental health;to provide comprehensive, integrated and responsive mental health and social care services in community-based settings;to implement strategies for promotion and prevention in mental health;to strengthen information systems, evidence and research for mental health' (p. 34).The survey data also suggest that MHSW can and does make a contribution to enable the World Health Organisation's 2013-2020 vision for mental health to be realised.
