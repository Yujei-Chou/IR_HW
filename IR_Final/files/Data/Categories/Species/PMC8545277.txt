According to the intelligent evaluation index system of emergency management, the BP neural network model is designed the feasible evaluation program is given. Evaluation elements can be divided into: subject (Comprehensive Evaluation), object (in the evaluation model, the object corresponding to the evaluation subject is also the evaluation object selected for the problem to be solved in this paper), standard (evaluation basis of the object) and method (efficient evaluation method).By summarizing a large number of emergency management literature, a complete set of intelligent evaluation index system of government emergency management is established, including 3 first-class indicators and 15 second-class indicators.
