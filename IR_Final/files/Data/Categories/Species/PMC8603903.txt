In the past two decades, three coronaviruses with ancestral origins in bats have emerged and caused widespread outbreaks in humans, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In humans, ACE2 expression is particularly high in the upper respiratory tract, while DPP4 is expressed mainly in the lower respiratory tract, potentially contributing to the greater human-to-human transmissibility of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 compared with MERS-CoV. Additionally, DPP4 expression is almost entirely restricted to the intestines in two vespertilionid bats, the putative reservoir of the MERS-CoV progenitor, suggesting different tropism, and potentially transmission routes, between reservoir and spillover hosts. It remains unclear whether the spatiotemporal patterns of coronavirus prevalence and shedding seen in some bat populations are generalizable.
