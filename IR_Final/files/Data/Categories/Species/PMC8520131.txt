This cross-sectional study evaluates the change in rates of pregnancy complications during the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women with commercial health insurance across the US. Results were similar in sensitivity analyses restricted to 186 464 women (57.4%) who were continuously enrolled in a commercial health insurance plan throughout the study period. We found little evidence of heterogeneity across states, except for gestational diabetes (I2 = 9.5%, P = .04) (Figure).To our knowledge, this is the largest and most comprehensive study to date of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adverse pregnancy outcomes.
