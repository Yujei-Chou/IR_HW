Globally, significant mortality and morbidity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have been documented in over 216 countries/territories of the world. The aim of this study therefore, was to review community-level responses to infectious disease outbreaks in SSA and highlight strategies that would be useful in managing the present COVID-19 pandemic. A four-prong approach in sensitizing community members on "socially and culturally" appropriate Ebola virus disease (EVD) prevention practices was implemented.
