Due to the current global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, rapid and accurate diagnostic tools are needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 across the globe. The measurements were tested at different direct potential ranges from 0.3 to 1 V where the remarkable impedimetric signals were achieved at 1 V (Supporting Information, Figure S3). Despite S15, S17, and S19 being SARS-CoV-2-positive by the PCR cutting the threshold line at cycles 31, 33, and 35, respectively, the impedimetric signals (0.809 +- 0.016, 0.828 +- 0.044, and 0.777 +- 0.029 KOmega) reflected the practical response of the proposed sensor toward the target virus and confirmed that the resulting Cts of PCR cannot provide viral payload in the tested sample.
