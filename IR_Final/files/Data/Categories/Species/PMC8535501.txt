The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic since its onset has had a dramatic and often devastating impact, both physical and psychological, on all healthcare workers. The multiple logistics regression (Table 5) shows that nurses working in the outpatient department reported a significantly higher stress level (AOR 3.740; 95% CI 1.983-7.053; p < 0.001) while nurses having chronic health problems reported a significantly higher depression level (AOR 4.687; 95% CI 2.268-9.682; p < 0.001).The primary finding of this nationwide study is that more than three-quarters of the nurses experienced stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Turning to religion to cope with stress yielded the highest score among the coping strategies employed by Malaysian nurses.
