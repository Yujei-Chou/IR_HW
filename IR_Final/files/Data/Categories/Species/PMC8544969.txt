University settings have demonstrated potential for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks; they combine congregate living, substantial social activity, and a young population predisposed to mild illness. We included 262 samples from students in dormitories A and B and 875 samples from persons tested at University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics (UWHC) from September 1, 2020-January 31, 2021; these samples represented  3% of all cases within Dane County, where UW-Madison is located, during this period. During September 23, 2020-January 31, 2021, a total of 75.3% (538/714) of new sequences in Dane County were classified as 20G clade, 15.1% (108/714) as 20A clade, 7.0% (50/714) as 20C clade, and 2.5% (18/714) as 20B clade.
