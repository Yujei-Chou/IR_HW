Background:
The COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading throughout the world, along with its strange and frightening mutations. The birth weight of 78.0% of neonates was >=2.5 kg, whereas 2 (4.9%) of neonates had a birth weight of less than 1.5 kg [Table 3, and Figure 1].SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and we do not have much knowledge about COVID-19 and its maternal and newborn adverse outcomes to date. In this study, all the neonatal pharyngeal swabs were found negative for the COVID-19 RT-PCR test.
