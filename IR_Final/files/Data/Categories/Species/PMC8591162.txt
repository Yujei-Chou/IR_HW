Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 235 million individuals and led to more than 4.8 million deaths worldwide as of October 5 2021. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that N322 glycan binds to the core region of RBD of S protein from amino acid 369 to 378. Notably, Lentil lectin derived from Lens culinaris can bind specifically to oligomannose-type glycans and GlcNAc at the non-reducing end terminus of S protein, thus block the binding of ACE2 to S trimer, showing the strongly inhibit infection of SARS-COV-2, including epidemic variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1.The major cause of death by SARS-CoV-2 refers to the "cytokine storm", which is featured as excess release of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-6.
