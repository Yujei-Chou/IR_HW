Over 10 million individuals pass through U.S. detention centers on an annual basis, with nearly two-thirds meeting criteria for drug dependence/abuse. With the exception of one patient who refused treatment after 3 days of buprenorphine treatment, the majority of individuals were maintained within our care while incarcerated and were either retained in buprenorphine treatment for the duration of their incarceration (n = 5) or were tapered and transitioned to naltrexone at the patient's request (n = 1).Slated to begin in the first quarter of 2020, implementation of our telemedicine-based buprenorphine in jail program co-occurred with the emergence of the COVID-19 public health emergency. An ongoing challenge surrounds the unpredictability of individuals' entry and length of stay in the detention center.
