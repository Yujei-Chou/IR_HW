Current therapies to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) involve vaccines against the spike (S) protein S1 of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we outline an alternative approach involving chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) in T-cells (CAR-Ts). CAR-Ts further showed potent in vitro killing of target cells loaded with RBD, S1 peptide or expressing the S1 protein.
