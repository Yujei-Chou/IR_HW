The humoral and cellular immunity of convalescent COVID-19 patients is involved in pathogenesis and vaccine immunity. 3b).Moreover, all the 13 non-severe patients were negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgM, whereas 29.4% (5/17) of the severe patients were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgM (chi2 = 4.588, P = 0.032) (Table 1).When the serums of COVID-19 convalescent patients were diluted as 1:125, the inhibition rate against SARS-CoV-2 infection was as high as 60%, whereas the inhibition rate was less than 30% when the serums of healthy blood donors were diluted as 1:5. The spot forming units by the IFN-gamma ELISpot test was similar in severe and non-severe COVID-19 convalescent patients (Fig.
