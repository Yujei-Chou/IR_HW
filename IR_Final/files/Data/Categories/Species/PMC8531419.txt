Carotenoids, a group of phytochemicals, are naturally found in the Plant kingdom, particularly in fruits, vegetables, and algae. Furthermore, beta-cryptoxanthin prevents nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice by reducing expression of M1 and M2 macrophages, T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells, suppresses expression of LPS-inducible and/or TNF-alpha-inducible genes in NASH, and decreases thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, markers of oxidative stress, which is considered a major mechanism of inflammation in liver. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, beta-cryptoxanthin demonstrated a potentially beneficial effect on health and on preventing immunity of related diseases by increasing CD4+ lymphocytes and serum IgG, IgM, and IgA levels in mammals.
