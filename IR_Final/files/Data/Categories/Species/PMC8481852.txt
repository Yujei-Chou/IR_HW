Benign metabolic uptake on fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) is not uncommonly seen after immunization. Interim 18F-FDG PET/computed tomography demonstrated complete metabolic response of prior hypermetabolic bilateral supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph nodes. Keeping in view of history, these new findings at the left axilla are likely related to recent vaccination, a diagnosis of benign 18F-FDG uptake in the normal-sized axillary lymph nodes is made, and the follow-up is advised.18F-FDG PET is enormously used in diagnostic staging, restaging, and response evaluation in cancer patients; however, these findings are nonspecific for cancers and can also found in inflammatory and infectious conditions.
