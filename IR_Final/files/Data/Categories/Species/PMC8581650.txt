The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on tuberculosis (TB) disease and TB services emerged in the beginning of 2020 [1, 2]. An increased use of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed in some TB centres [11]. Similarly, the overall TB deaths decreased from 795 in 2019 to 622 in 2020, but subsequently increased in May 2020 (figure 1e) (66+-9 per month in 2019 versus 52+-9 per month in 2020; p=0.0006).Newly diagnosed TB disease in outpatient clinics reduced from 7364 in 2019 to 5703 in 2020, with a significant decline in March 2020, except the centres in Australia and Virginia (USA) (figure 1f) (613+-57 per month in 2019 versus 475+-90 per month in 2020; p=0.0005).
