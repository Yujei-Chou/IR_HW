Aims: We present the sequence and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis for 47 complete genomes for SARS-CoV-2 isolates on Turkish patients. This study was approved by both the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health COVID-19 Scientific Research Evaluation Commission (approval date: 02/05/2020; number: 2020-05-02T16_13_50) and the Local Ethics Committee of Kafkas University Faculty of Medicine (approval date: 06/05/2020 number: 80576354-050-99/130).Of the patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the 63 samples with the highest viral loads (assessed by real-time PCR by Biospeedy SARS-CoV-2 qPCR Kit targeting the RdRp gene) were selected for NGS-based assays. According to the current literature, ORF genes have a crucial role in COVID-19.
