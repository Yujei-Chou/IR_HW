{'Disease', 'Species', 'Gene'}
In a recent editorial published in this 'Journal of Public Health' (Oxford), editors Professor Premila Webster and Professor Keith Neal critically pointed out that an inclusive approach on strategies and policies for COVID-19 and future pandemics is direly needed to address glaring gap between rich and poor countries. The editorial rightfully emphasized that, 'there needs to be a global recognition of long-standing social inequities related to race, disability, class, caste and gender'. Henceforth, this paper urges GAVI-WHO and EU-US centrality to step up joint strategic partnerships, including but not limited to G7, G20, Mercosur, PA, AU and ASEAN blocs toward an enhanced 'joint emergency COVID-19 vaccine task force', to include more specific innovative 'mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub' across the world and to address the issue on 'business as usual approach' encompassing COVID-19 vaccines procurement, roll-out and manufacturing production between the rich and poor countries during pandemics.
