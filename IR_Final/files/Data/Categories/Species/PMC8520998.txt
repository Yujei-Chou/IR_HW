This study explored the impact of online lectures that were developed using principles of cognitive load theory (CLT) and cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML) on health profession students' lecture comprehension, cognitive load, cognitive engagement, and intrinsic motivation in learning. During the end phase, the lecturers conducted several lecturing strategies that can enhance students' GL in the form of SPL. The analysis revealed that the improvement in the test scores within both the face-to-face freestyle and the CLT-based lectures were highly significant (mean difference +- SEM = 19.5 +- 1.6, t-stats = 12.5, df = 214, and p < 0.001), indicating that the students' understanding of the lecture content had increased after each lecture.
