Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020,   and the Korean government implemented infection prevention policies, including social distancing and stay-at-home orders. The slope in Figure 2 reflects the conditional moderating effects of depression on NSSI of different levels of problematic alcohol use. A study which was conducted during the same period reported that the prevalence of NSSI among Taiwanese adolescents:measured using a question (in the past year, have you ever engaged in the following behaviors to deliberately injure yourself but without suicidal intent?):was 40.9%,   therefore, the prevalence of self-destructive behavior among university students cannot be considered as being significantly lower.
