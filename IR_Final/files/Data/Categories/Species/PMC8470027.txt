The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 represents a public health emergency, which became even more challenging since the detection of highly transmissible variants and strategies against COVID-19 were indistinctly established. VLDS of the deltaV patient was assessed in the context of a reference group composed of 112 individuals matched for age (12 < Age < 22) and sex. Moreover, the duration of the infection significantly differed between OSs carriers with different VLDS and these data were reinforced by the medium effect size obtained by comparing slow VLDS vs. medium/fast VLDS individuals (Supplementary Materials: Table S1).Successively, we aimed at classifying individuals with specific times of infection resolution, considering the VLDS.
