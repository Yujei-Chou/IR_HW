In a survey and three experiments (one preregistered with a nationally representative sample), we examined if vaccination requirements are likely to backfire, as commonly feared. This study was followed by three experiments, the final one preregistered, comparing different scenarios about a vaccination decision in the workplace. Specifically, when only 30% of the population supported vaccination and participants had lower reactance (- 1SD of the mean), requiring the vaccine had no effect on intentions (requirement vs. freedom: t(708) = 2.14, p = .08; requirement vs. control for choice freedom: t(708) = 1.37, p = .36).
