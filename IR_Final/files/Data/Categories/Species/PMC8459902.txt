Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted hospital care, as hospitals had to deal with a highly infectious virus, while at the same time continuing to fulfill the ongoing health service needs of their communities. DRG cancer classes in which reduction in activity was below the average included: ENT malignancy (3%; p = 0.7115); Procedures of Malignant Breast (7%; p = 0.0130); Malignant Breast Disorders (12%; p = 0.0076); and Lymphoma and Leukemia (12%; p < 0.0001). CHIF's DRG data shows that there was an increase of 6,658 cases (from the average of 17,875 over the 3-year pre-COVID-19 period, to 24,533 cases in 2020), in the six DRG respiratory classes in which cases could be attributed to treatment for COVID-19.
