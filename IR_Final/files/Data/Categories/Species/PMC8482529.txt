In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic set the research community on a new path to understand the virus, how it affects different populations, and how it influences access to essential services. It is in this context that the value of the publication in The Lancet Oncology by Sheena Mukkada and colleagues can be understood. Deaths from COVID-19 were also higher in patients from low-income and lower-middle-income countries than patients from upper-middle-income countries, and high-income countries, despite the under-representation of low-income countries (African, South-East Asian, and Western Pacific Regions), probably secondary to the scarcity of SARS-CoV-2 testing or overwhelmed services that were unable to report cases.
