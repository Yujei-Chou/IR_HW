The COVID-19 pandemic has infected 33 million Americans and resulted in more than 600,000 deaths as of late Spring 2021. Despite the efforts made to encourage and provide access to COVID-19 vaccines, current vaccination rates among BIL communities remain disproportionately low. Tracking vaccinations in BIL communities is also imprecise, with limitations and gaps in vaccination data.
