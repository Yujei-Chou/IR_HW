The aim of this study was to present and evaluate novel oral vaccines, based on self-amplifying RNA lipid nanparticles (saRNA LNPs), saRNA transfected Lactobacillus plantarum LNPs, and saRNA transfected Lactobacillus plantarum, to neutralize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) variants alpha and delta. As seen, Lactobacillus plantarum LNPs had the bigger size distribution and less zeta potential. The correlation analysis between SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG or IgA titer and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titer can be seen in Supplementary 1.Splenocytes from mice immunized with saRNA LNPs, saRNA transfected Lactobacillus plantarum LNPs, and saRNA transfected Lactobacillus plantarum alone had a high IFN-gamma secretion with dose-dependent manner (Fig.
