Background
In September of 2020, roughly half of United States (US) universities and colleges allowed at least some students back for in-person instruction. I suggest the authors re-consider the effect size in light of data related to SARS-CoV-2. Most often in cost effectiveness analyses, both cases prevented and QALYs (gained) are presented as outcomes.[Response] Thank you.
