Background
During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries introduced aggressive physical distancing strategies, such as closing schools and businesses, cancelling sporting events and asking people to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility, as a way to slow the spread of the outbreak. The present study was conducted during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. Of all the variables examined, univariate analyses found that older age and being male were protective for depressive symptoms with statistical significance; on the other hand, being unemployed, being a student, not currently working, higher number of days in isolation, the perceived notion of being infected without confirmation, being under psychiatric care and taking psychiatric medication were risk factors for depressive symptoms with statistical significance.
