Health care systems have encountered unprecedented challenges during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, such as standardizing care in the absence of high-quality data. We noted that the landscape of anticoagulation strategies ranged from conservative, providing primarily prophylaxis-dose anticoagulation, to aggressive, which had a lower threshold for providing treatment-dose anticoagulation. In contrast, our protocol was significantly more aggressive in recommending therapeutic dose anticoagulation in hospitalized patients without evidence of a VTE.The initial protocol was released to the entire health system on April 10, 2020.
