Dear Editor,
Dear Editor,The world's most extreme health crisis in the last year has been the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has affected over 200 countries and spread across 6 continents. Globally, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is used as a treatment modality for respiratory support in 63% of cases, cardiac support in 29% of cases, and both respiratory and cardiac support in 8% of cases, according to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization. According to perfusion technologists, wearing personal protection kits while performing intensive patient care is exhausting.
