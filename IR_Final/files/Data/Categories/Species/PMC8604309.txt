Background
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 200 million cases and led to over 4 million deaths worldwide since it was first reported in Wuhan, China, on the 31st of December 2019. We noted that since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, 23.2% of our respondents needed to take a pharmaceutical. The profile of alcohol consumption in our sample (N = 1666) revealed that from the 48.9% of the respondents who drink alcohol, 16% increased their consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic.
