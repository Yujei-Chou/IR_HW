Influenza viruses typically circulate in the temperate climates of the northern hemisphere from late fall through early spring and constitute a considerable burden on population health and healthcare systems. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended to adapt influenza surveillance systems and complement them with the COVID-19 surveillance, using severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI)/acute ARI syndromic surveillance systems in primary care, in anticipation of the co-circulation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The need for integrated testing and surveillance of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 became very clear in the current pandemic.
