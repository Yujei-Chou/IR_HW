Background: Refusal to receive the COVID-19 vaccine or hesitancy is a global threat. The evidence-based strategies suggest a multilevel intervention to face the COVID-19 hesitancy, which includes the following: (1) organizational intervention; (2) interpersonal intervention; and (3) individual intervention. In this project, we addressed the healthcare organizational barriers that would improve the hesitancy status.
