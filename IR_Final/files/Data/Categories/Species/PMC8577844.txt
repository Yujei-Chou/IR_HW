Non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) has increasingly been used in the management of COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure, but questions remain about the utility, safety, and outcome benefit of NIRS strategies. The two randomised controlled trials indicate superiority of non-invasive ventilation over high-flow nasal oxygen in reducing the need for intubation. The Italian RCT from Grieco and colleagues compared HFNO with BiPAP in 109 patients; although the difference in median days free of respiratory support was not statistically significant, the rate of endotracheal intubation was significantly lower in the BiPAP group (30%) compared with those randomised to HFNO (51%), with more days free of invasive mechanical ventilation.
