Advances in nanotechnology have enabled the development of a new generation of vaccines, which are playing a critical role in the global control of the COVID-19 pandemic and the return to normalcy. This makes the country the only one on the continent of Africa with the advanced technological capability and expertise to establish COVID-19 vaccine development and manufacture. Recently, South African researchers could implement bioinformatics strategies of reverse vaccinology and immuno-informatics in vaccine design and development on a new big data platform for data-intensive research in bioinformatics (; accessed on 1 October 2021).Reverse vaccinology is a way of using bioinformatics tools to identify features in bacteria, viruses, parasites, cancer cells, or allergens that could trigger an immune response.
