Mental health is severely challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic due to a variety of restrictions in public and private life. Again, students and professionals did not differ in their retrospective, pre-pandemic assessment (M Diff = 0.23, t (646) = 3.14, ns), but students rated the experienced meaningfulness significantly lower than professionals at the current, peri-lockdown time point (M Diff = 0.94, t (646) = 8.18, p < 0.001).The present cross-sectional study investigated whether the COVID-19 pandemic has a negative influence on perceived internal locus of control as well as on the sense of coherence in social work students. With results of a significantly decreasing sense of coherence during the COVID-19 pandemic, the original assumption is challenged.
