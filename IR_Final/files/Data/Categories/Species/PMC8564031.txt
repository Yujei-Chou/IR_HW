Letter to the Editor:We describe a case of delayed COVID-19 diagnosis due to unrecognized community transmission in Atlanta, Georgia, in mid-February 2020. On February 28, 2020 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced guidelines recommending COVID-19 testing for persons with compatible symptoms and either recent travel to COVID-19 affected regions, contact with known COVID-19 cases, or "fever with severe acute lower respiratory illness (eg, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] requiring hospitalization and without an alternative explanatory diagnosis)" (Fig 1). He was admitted to the medical floor for further evaluation, where droplet and contact precautions were continued for the remainder of hospitalization.
