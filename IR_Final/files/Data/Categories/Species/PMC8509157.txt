Worldwide, lung transplantation has been a therapeutic option for select end-stage lung disease patients who are on optimized medical regimens, but the underlying clinical condition continues to progress. Size reduced lung transplantation, including split-lung transplantation, lobar transplantation, and peripheral segmental resection, is a reliable procedure providing equal results compared to standard lung transplantation as mentioned by Aigner et al. The 30-d survival rate (81% pre-SALT; 99% SALT; P = 0.005) and the 1-year survival rate (76% pre-SALT; 85% SALT; P = 0.14) improved after the implementation of the SALT protocolSome common physiological derangements in brain dead patients are hypothermia, hypotension, diabetes insipidus, DIC, arrhythmias, and pulmonary edema.
