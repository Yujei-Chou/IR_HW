Background
In late January 2020, COVID-19 was first detected in the United Kingdom (UK), and in response to increasing incidence and hospitalisations, the UK entered the first of three national lockdowns on the 23rd of March 2020. A recent analysis of hospital data in England ascribes an average of 40,800 (with an interquartile range (IQR) of 40,500-41,400) hospital episodes where norovirus was the primary diagnosis and a further 61,500 (IQR 58,700-62,500) with norovirus as a secondary diagnosis, meaning that norovirus is a significant public health and economic burden in England and during hospital outbreaks can result in ward closures. Additional model outputs were provided as a form of validation against what we would expect a realistic model of norovirus to output; estimates asymptomatic prevalence, a proxy for seroprevalence (assumed here to be the proportion of individuals that have recently recovered from symptomatic infection) and estimates of R0.
