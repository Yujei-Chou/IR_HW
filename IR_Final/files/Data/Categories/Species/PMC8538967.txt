The efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccines in preventing COVID-19 disease has been extensively demonstrated; however, it is of uttermost importance to acquire knowledge on the persistence of immune-protection both in terms of levels of neutralizing antibodies and specialized memory cells. Therefore, taking into consideration that antibodies and memory T-cells, both CD4+ and CD8+, are all involved in protective immunity for both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against COVID-19, we assessed the longitudinal stability of SARS-CoV-2 T responses in BNT162b2 vaccinated adults as well as the changes in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgGs, 15 and 150 days following the boost with the second dose of vaccine. The test screened as positive subjects having IgG levels above the laboratory 1.2 cut-off.
