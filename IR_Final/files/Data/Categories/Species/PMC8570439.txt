Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are at an increased thrombotic risk, hence thromboprophylaxis with heparin is considered mandatory. Non-survivors had worse Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores on ICU admission and were more likely to require invasive mechanical ventilation during ICU stay (Table 1).ATIII levels were lower in non-survivors as compared to that in survivors on all three days of measurement and this was significant (p-value 0.002) on the third day of ICU admission. Blasi et al reported in vitro normal thrombin generation despite detectable anti-Xa activity in the majority of COVID-19 patients but enhanced in vivo thrombin generation as evidenced by elevated levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes and D-dimers.
