The dynamics of epidemics depend on how people's behavior changes during an outbreak. The model parameters have been successfully fitted to best match the statistical observations of epidemics in different countries of the world. 6.According to the described transitions, the SIRSS model has five variables: Sign(t), Sres(t), Sexh(t), I(t), R(t), and can be formulated as follows:where K1 = q is the rate of transition to the resistant state mediated by a stress response in society, K2 is the exhaustion rate due to restrictions (K2 << 1), K3 is the constant of transition to a state of ignorance (K3 << 1), K4 = a is the morbidity rate, K5 = b is the recovery constant.
