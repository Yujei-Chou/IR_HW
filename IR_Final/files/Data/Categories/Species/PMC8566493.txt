We aimed to investigate the associations of previous influenza/URI with the susceptibility of COVID-19 patients compared to that of non-COVID-19 participants. The susceptibility/morbidity/mortality associated with prior histories of 1-14, 1-30, 1-90, 15-45, 15-90, and 31-90 days before COVID-19 onset were analyzed using conditional/unconditional logistic regression. The histories of influenza/URI in previous 15-45 days, 15-90 days, and 31-90 days and the number of medical visits for influenza/URI during the previous 1-365 days were not related to COVID-19 mortality (Table S8).However, the OR of mortality was increased in some subgroups (Figs.
