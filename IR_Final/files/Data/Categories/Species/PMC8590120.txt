Our study was conducted to determine the spiritual care needs and death anxiety levels of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. Among the patients, 53.9% (n = 207) did not have a chronic disease, while 55.2% (n = 212) were hospitalized after being diagnosed with COVID-19 (Table 1).The mean total spiritual care requirements scale (SCRS) score of the participants was 67.05 +- 26.30. This result suggested that the patients required spiritual care in the period they were diagnosed with COVID-19.
