Despite considerable progress in the development of antiviral drugs, among which anti-immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) medications can be considered real success stories, many viral infections remain without an effective treatment. Regardless of this consideration, remdesivir remains an intriguing molecule that may inspire future structural optimization programs for the development of potent RdRp inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection. PF-00835231 inhibited recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity with nanomolar potency (Ki = 0.271 nM) with excellent off-target selectivity, while exhibiting potent and highly selective antiviral activity in both cellular assays and in vivo murine SARS-CoV-2 model either as a single agent or in combination with remdesivir.
