Graphic Abstract
Currently, mucosal vaccination constitutes a compelling strategy for infectious diseases and cancer due to its several advantages: is able to induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses, differing from parenteral immunization that mainly induces a systemic response (Kraehenbuhl and Neutra), mucosal tissues cover a wide surface area (~ 400 m2 in a human adult) (Kraehenbuhl and Neutra), and approximately 80% of total immune cells in a healthy adult are associated to mucosal surfaces (Czerkinsky and Holmgren). Currently, a second generation of LALF32-51 -derived peptides has been studied for its antitumor effect (Guerra-Vallespi et al.; However, the IgG response generated by the two former groups reached values more closer to the obtained for the alum adjuvated control group (p < 0.05).Considering that the generation of a Th1 pattern of immune response would be of interest for several vaccine candidates and the fact that the induction of IgG2a subclass in mice correlates with this kind of response (Snapper and Paul) the HBs-specific IgG2a antibody response was evaluated after the last dose (Fig.
