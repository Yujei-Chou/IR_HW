In less than two years since SARS-CoV-2 emerged, the new coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, has accumulated a great number of mutations. Once the Gamma VOC was detected, its spreading throughout the country was monitored by a one-step PCR and sequencing of a smaller fragment of 293 bp, by using primers 76.1 L (5 -CCAGATGATTTTACAGGCTGCG-3') and 76.8R (5 -GTTGCTGGTGCATGTAGAAGTTC-3'), and the following PCR conditions: an incubation at 55  C for 30 min, followed by 94  C/3 min and 40 cycles of 94  C/15 s, 55  C/30 s and 68  C/30 s, with a final extension of 68  C for 7 min. Complete genome analysis of selected samples confirmed the presence of Gamma VOC (lineage P.1) circulating in Venezuela (Fig.
