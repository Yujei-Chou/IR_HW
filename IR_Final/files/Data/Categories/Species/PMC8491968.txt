Cerebrovascular diseases attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are uncommon but can result in devastating outcomes. Herein we present a pediatric patient who underwent endovascular therapy for an acute ischemic stroke in the setting of active COVID-19 with an excellent outcome. At the time of this report, only 1 other case of endovascular therapy in COVID-19 associated pediatric ischemic stroke has been described but with this patient having a medical condition - severe anemia with a hemoglobin of 2.8 gm/dl needing blood transfusion that could have confounded the clinical presentation.
