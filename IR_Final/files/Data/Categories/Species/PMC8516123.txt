The increasing prevalence of N501Y variants of SARS-CoV-2 has kindled global concern due to their enhanced transmissibility. Among 134 samples without N501Y, majority of them were genotyped as B.1.36.27 (n = 39, 30 %) and B.1.1.63 (n = 23, 17.7 %) (Table S1, Supplemental Material).For determination of analytical sensitivity, one sample of B.1.1.7 (N501Y variant) and B.1.36.27 (non-N501Y variant) were quantified with SARS-CoV-2 Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) Kit (BIO-RAD, US) and were normalized to 1500 copies/muL respectively, followed by serially diluted down to 0.15 copies/muL. Both sets of dilutions were tested with the optimized RT-qPCR protocol in 10 replicates on four different qPCR platforms. Evelyn Yin-Kwan WONG: Methodology, Validation, Writing - Review & Editing.
