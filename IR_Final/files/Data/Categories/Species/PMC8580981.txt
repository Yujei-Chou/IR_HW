To meet the unprecedented requirement of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, a large number of diagnostic kits were authorized by concerned authorities for diagnostic use within a short period of time during the initial phases of the ongoing pandemic. Similarly, a panel of 60 control samples was created, including healthy individuals and patients infected with other respiratory viruses (n = 30, in each group).We observed varying sensitivity and specificity among the evaluated kits, with LabGun COVID-19 RT-PCR kit showing the highest sensitivity and specificity (94% and 100% respectively), followed by TaqPath COVID-19 Combo and Allplex 2019-nCoV assay (Table 1).We estimated inter-test agreement between the NIV kit and the five other evaluated kits. On the other hand, the correlation coefficients for both RdRp and ORF-1ab genes were not significant for any of the evaluated kits.
