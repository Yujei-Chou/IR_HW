There is a gap in the epidemiological data on obesity and COVID-19 mortality in low and middle-income countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including Peru. These findings suggest that as obesity prevalence increases, the COVID-19 mortality rates increase in the Peruvian population >= 15 years. Adjusted by possible confounding factors (mean age in the region, mean monthly income, gender balance and number of ICU beds), only the prevalence rate of obesity was associated with COVID-19 mortality rate (beta = 0.585; p = 0.033) (Table 2).
