The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the latest biological hazard for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For which purpose, the integrated areas were assessed at 1420-1289 cm-1 and 1160-1028 cm-1 regions to evaluate IgM, 1560-1464 cm-1 which correspond to IgG, and finally, the area at 1285-1237 cm-1 corresponded to IgA. Once the integrated areas were calculated, a Mann-Whitney test was developed to determine any significant differences between COVID-19 and the healthy group. in 2011, evaluated the utility of FTIR spectroscopy for rapid detection of infective virus particles poliovirus in cell cultures, and Santos et al.
