COVID-19 pandemic challenges have accelerated the reliance on digital health fuelling the expanded incorporation of mobile apps into healthcare services, particularly for the management of long-term conditions such as chronic diseases (CDs). While many studies adopted engagement strategies in design involving both users and HCPs, there were a few exceptions. The types of primary outcome measures varied in terms of core areas, although they most frequently pertained to physiological and clinical outcomes (n = 29, 51.8% of the total primary outcomes identified in the studies), followed by life impact (n = 23, 41.1%), resource use (n = 3, 5.4%) and adverse events (n = 1, 1.8%).Regarding specific outcome domains, endocrine outcomes were the most commonly reported, haemoglobin A1c levels (n = 20), with only seven studies reporting significant differences between groups at follow-up.
