This study aims to examine whether and how user-generated comments and reaction emojis on COVID-19 vaccine-promoting Facebook posts induce psychological reactance to posts and vaccine hesitancy in audiences of the posts. Concerning RQ2, the first MANOVA that we conducted with two types of comments, two types of reaction emojis and two types of pre-existing attitudes as fixed variables; and with bandwagon perception, presumed influence, anger, negative cognition, and vaccine hesitancy as dependent variables, showed that the multivariate effect of pre-existing attitudes was significant (Wilks' lambda = .43, F [5, 451] = 118.50, p < .001, eta2 = 0.57). This may result from the difference in audiences' perceived similarity with the commenters and message source.
