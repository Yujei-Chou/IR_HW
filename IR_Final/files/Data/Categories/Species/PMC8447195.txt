Dear Editor,
Dear Editor,Blumenthal et al. Thus, at the development of delayed local skin reactions, none of the patients experienced concurrent systemic symptoms. Our report suggests that the delayed local cutaneous reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines are not vaccine-specific, since both mRNA vaccine and viral-vector vaccine showed such reactions.
