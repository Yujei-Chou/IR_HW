Background
Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a major health challenge, devastating many communities and economies around the world. Subgroup analysis showed that the highest and lowest seroprevalences were estimated using ELISA (12.12%, 10.78-13.46%) and virus neutralization (0.94%, 0.63-1.26%), respectively. Subgroup analyses of the data showed that the lowest seroprevalences were observed when the confirmed cases (4.66%, 3.59-5.73%) and total deaths (6.38%, 5.36-7.41%) were lower than 10 000 and 1000 cases, respectively (Table S5).
