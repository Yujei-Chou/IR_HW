A final comparison between self-diagnosis and medical diagnosis, through the societal point of view, for the COVID-19 pandemic is presented. A final logistic regression analysis, considering the volition to go to the hospital as a dependent variable, found that reliability (OR 3.207; CI 1987-5182; p = 0.000) and EDs' effectiveness (OR 3.506; CI 2167-5670; p = 0.000) had a significant impact on people's willingness to go to the ED instead of a private physician, if needed (Table 5).Society's trajectory of futuristic technological has wielded a remarkable impact on scientific medical advancements over the last few years.
