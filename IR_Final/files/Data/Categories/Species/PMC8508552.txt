FIBROWALK is a multicomponent program including pain neuroscience education, therapeutic exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness training that has recently been found to be effective in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). As far as we know, it was the first study to evaluate the short-term efficacy of a virtual multicomponent treatment for the management of FM. Relatedly, in a recent small (i.e., 17 individuals per arm) clinical trial conducted in Spanish patients with FM also during the COVID-19 lockdown, an intensive 15-week (2 sessions/week) telerehabilitation program based on aerobic exercise showed positive effects on pain intensity, functional impairment and psychological distress compared to a passive control group.
