The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a growing problem. HFNC oxygenation therapy represents a cornerstone element for the treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We strongly believe that the use of HFNC oxygenation in patients with high-risk or intermediate-high-risk PE could be an attractive option to support acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in this type of patients, to avoid the effects of positive pressure ventilation on the RV, being a feasible option to use HFNC oxygenation as a respiratory therapeutic leverage/bridge if further reperfusion strategies are considered, with the possibility to avoid rapid cardiopulmonary decompensation and the need of MV.
