Background
The Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS -Corona virus-2 has been spreading across the globe since December 2019. As the S/Co values reflect relative levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, we categorised the antibodies as category 1; S/CO 1-5 (41.8 %, 123/294), and category 2; S/CO > 5 (58.16 % 171/294). Most of the studies have shown the seroprevalence in blood donors during the early part of the pandemic and details are given in Table 4 .
