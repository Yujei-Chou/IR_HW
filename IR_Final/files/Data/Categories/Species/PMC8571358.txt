Prediction of complex epidemiological systems such as COVID-19 is challenging on many grounds. We designed a multi-variate recurrent neural network with LSTM layers to predict three variables of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths, as well as foot traffic for multiple sub-populations using an iterated multi-step (IMS) estimation. In this research, we used an IMS method since the length of the prediction horizon is not long.
