Objective: To analyze the effect of applying alternative diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during the COVID-19 pandemic on GDM prevalence and obstetrical and perinatal outcomes, in comparison to usual diagnostic approaches. Perinatal data and the rate of any perinatal complication were similar between GDM and non-GDM women in both 2019 and 2020 (Table 1).When GDM women from 2019-group and 2020-group were compared (Table 2), we found that women in 2020-group were less frequently nulligravid (50% vs. 21.6%, p = 0.006) and that they had a higher prevalence of macrosomia in previous pregnancies (2.5% vs. 29.7%, p = 0.004). Women in 2020-group had a higher prevalence of GDM and macrosomia in previous pregnancies.
