Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic with worldwide 6-digit infection rates and thousands of death tolls daily. The procoagulant activities and tissue factor induction by various superantigens from Staphylococcus aureus, including enterotoxin A (EA), enterotoxin B (EB), and toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)-1, were tested for their ability to induce procoagulant activity and tissue factor (TF) expression:a major initiator of blood coagulation expressed predominantly on monocytic cells and endothelial cells:in human whole blood and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In one study, the authors assessed the influence of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and P-selectin on the clearance of platelets following adenovirus administration.
