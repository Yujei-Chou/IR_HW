SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent behind the COVID-19 pandemic, responsible for over 170 million infections, and over 3.7 million deaths worldwide. Of those significantly regulated neo-N-termini, causal proteases were identified for a subset, although the analysis did not find the overall activities of these causal proteases to be significantly regulated in infected cells at 24 h post-infection compared to mock-infected cells (p < 0.05, Adjusted Fisher's exact test) Supplementary data 8, although this may reflect low numbers of annotated substrates for individual proteases. Infection of A549-Ace2 cells was performed 24 h post-transfection with the indicated siRNA and allowed to proceed for 72 h (Fig.
