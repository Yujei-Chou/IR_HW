B cell-targeting strategies such as rituximab are widely used in B cell hematologic malignancies, rheumatologic and musculoskeletal diseases and a variety of autoimmune disorders. In a small series of NHL patients treated with CP in association with an extended course of remdesivir, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NS or BAL samples turned negative after a median of only 10.6 days (10 to 12).As outlined before, clinical recovery often precedes PCR negativization in respiratory samples and appears to correlate more strongly with the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 viremia. Moreover, recent data support the use of the MoAbs combination of casirivimab/imdevimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 including patients with oxygen requirement who are seronegative.
