A 12-year-old male patient was diagnosed with plaque psoriasis when he was 5 years old and has been in remission for about 7 years. We believe that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might also play a role in the etiopathogenesis of pustular psoriasis through the stimulation of various inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-36.Few cases of co-existence of pustular psoriasis and COVID-19 have been reported. This is the first report of a pediatric patient who developed pustular psoriasis due to COVID-19 infection.
