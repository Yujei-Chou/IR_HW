Understanding the glycosylation of the envelope spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is important in defining the antigenic surface of this key viral target. The N-linked glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein has been previously studied, showing high occupancy of 22 PNGS;- however, there are differing reports about the level of occupancy, and localization of, O-linked glycans.- In this study we use kifunensine, which inhibits alpha1,2-mannosidases following the Calnexin/Calreticulin folding cycle, to simplify N-linked glycosylation prior to studying the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. We find that the use of kifunensine treatment helps reduce misassignments of glycan attachment sites derived from nearby N-glycans as O-glycosylation sites because of poor fragmentation.
