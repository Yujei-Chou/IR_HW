The large number of emerging antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for cancer therapy has resulted in a significant market 'boom', garnering worldwide attention. It is composed of a recombinant humanized anti-CD33 mAb (IgG4kappa antibody hP67.6) covalently attached to a calicheamicin derived payload (N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine dichloride) via a pH-sensitive hydrazone linker, see Figure 4.Highlighting the rocky start for ADC therapeutics, Mylotarg  was granted accelerated approval for relapsed CD33+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 2000, but was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 2010 after post-approval studies failed to verify survival benefit and demonstrated a higher rate of fatal toxicity than chemotherapy alone. As for all humanized antibodies, complementarity determining region (CDR) grafting was used for humanization of the anti-CD33 murine antibody, hP67.6, employed in Mylotarg .
