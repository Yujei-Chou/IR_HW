SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, but it is also detected in a significant proportion of fecal samples from COVID-19 cases. This manuscript describes: 1) the development of a standardized and efficient method for processing Moore swabs specifically for SARS-CoV-2 that includes an elution buffer to elute viruses off the swab, the use of a potato ricer (and more recently a stomacher) to process the swab samples, and subsequent virus concentration, RNA extraction, and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR, and 2) the application of this method to wastewater from a hospital, student residence halls on three campuses, and a quarantine building for known and suspected COVID-19 cases. From mid-August 2020 through March 2021, a total of 442 Moore swab samples were collected and analyzed.
