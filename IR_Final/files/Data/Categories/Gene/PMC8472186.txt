The virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 patients often have elevated levels of acute phase proteins and CRP, which indicate ongoing inflammation in the body. Based on available in vitro evidence, greater understanding of the aggressiveness of COVID-19, and available data on other viruses, we present for consideration the following nutraceuticals and dietary strategies:The elderberry (Sambucus nigra) may be useful against COVID-19 due to its capacity to stimulate the immune system and inhibit the replication of viruses, including human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), which differs from COVID-19 but belongs to the same family of coronaviruses.
