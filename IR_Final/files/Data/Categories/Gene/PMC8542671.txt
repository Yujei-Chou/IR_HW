Objectives: Many countries recently approved a number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. For example, all these guidelines abovementioned agree on first immunizing healthcare workers, who typically have very high risk of acquiring and transmitting Covid-19. However, "social/employment groups unable to social distance (examples: detention facilities, dormitories, low-income persons in dense urban neighbourhoods, homeless people and those living in informal settlements or urban slums, certain occupations e.g., mining)" are to be vaccinated, according to WHO, towards the end of the second phase ("localized or limited transmission", p.9) when vaccine availability become more widespread (ranging from 21-50%, p.10).Yet, we know that people in correctional facilities are prone to acquire all sort of infectious diseases.
