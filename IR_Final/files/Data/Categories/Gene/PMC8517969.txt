While the use of social media by local governments has gained relevance in recent years, crises are critical situations that reinforce the need to reach citizens to disclose information, demonstrate the government's commitment, and increase the citizens' level of preparedness and awareness of resources. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis: There is an association between the dominant ideology of the city council representatives and the number of publications by the municipalities. During these two phases, three variables play a negative role in e-disclosure; e-disclosure increases where Internet penetration is lower, where income inequalities within the municipal territory are lower (only during the plateau phase), and where electoral participation is lower (only during the peak of the crisis).
