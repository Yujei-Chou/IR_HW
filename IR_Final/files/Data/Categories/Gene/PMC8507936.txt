The aim of this study was to identify the epidemiological profiles of violence against children, victims, and their aggressors, and their correlations between socioeconomic and demographic factors analyzed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accounting for 29.9% of the physical violence consultations, self-inflicted violence was prevalent in female adolescents, corresponding to 76.1% of self-inflicted notifications (p < 0.01), whose mean age was 14.8 +- 2.7 years, as shown in Figure 2.The self-injury methods were drug intoxication (61.2%), self-mutilation (17.9%), poisoning (11.9%), illicit drug overdose (3%), hanging (3%), and falling (3%). This study concluded that parents and family members were responsible for most cases of violence against children and adolescents.
