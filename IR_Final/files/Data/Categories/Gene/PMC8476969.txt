The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global health crisis affecting millions of people worldwide. Considering the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary, we can expect the changes in the functionality of the HPA axis induced by SARS-CoV-2 to be similar to those seen with SARS-CoV-1 (Figure 1B and Table 1).So far, evidence of central hypocortisolism in patients with COVID-19 points towards critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI), also known as relative adrenal insufficiency. Suppression of the HPA axis in COVID-19 patients could also result from treatment with corticosteroids.
