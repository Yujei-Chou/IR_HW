COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality have been often attributed to an exaggerated immune response. We characterized the impact on the overall concentration of cytokines/chemokines through digital electrophoresis (Figure 1). Both methods, in addition to being efficient in the removal of viral particles, have interesting characteristics such as easy implementation even in BSL-3 laboratories requiring simple and commonly available equipment, and allow a low waste of time and money (Table 2).In this study, we presented two methods to recover cytokines and effectively eliminate the presence of active SARS-CoV-2 viruses from contaminated BAL samples: separation by centrifugal ultrafiltration and deactivation by UVC irradiation.
