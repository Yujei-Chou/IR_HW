COVID-19 may cause intussusception in infants. A literature review revealed 9 other cases with COVID-19 and intussusception. The association between COVID-19 and intussusception may be related to mesenteric lymphadenopathy and hypertrophy of Peyer patches, evoking a local reactive mesenteric adenitis which causes an alteration in peristaltic intestinal movement or acts as a lead point for the intussusceptum.
