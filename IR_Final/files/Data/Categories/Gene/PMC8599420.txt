SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, emerged a year ago in Wuhan, China causing a new pandemic. A significant weak negative correlation was found between the NLR and the number of days after PCR negativity, after which the antibody level was estimated (rs = - 0.2, p = 0.01) (Table 4).On comparing the serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels between individuals with and without symptoms, a significant increase in the antibody levels was observed between the subjects having cough (p = 0.0004) (Table 5). Around 40% of the study population failed to develop a significant antibody titre against the SARS-CoV-2.
