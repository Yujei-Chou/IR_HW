We conducted a cross-sectional study to compare the impact of social distancing and lifestyle changes that occurred during Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown on children and adolescents with and without Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs). All these conditions have "domains of difficulty" in common, although they can be compromised within various ranges of severity: emotional and behavioral issues, family stress, impaired learning, communication, and social skills (Thapar et al.,). A significant difference between NDDs and control group was found for Anxiety endpoint as well.
