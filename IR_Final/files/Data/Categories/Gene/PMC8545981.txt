Following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several clinical trials have been approved for the investigation of the possible use of mAbs, supporting the potential of this technology as a therapeutic approach for infectious diseases. Following these observations, it was suggested to use anti-TNF-alpha agents in combination with standard therapy in patients with massive skin sores caused by CL. The combination therapy led to smaller size lesions while anti-TNF-alpha monotherapy did not affect lesion size.mAb against junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM-C):involved in leukocyte migration through the endothelium:were reported to increase the Th1 response leading to reduced skin lesions and parasite burden in resistant C57BL/6 mice, while it boosted the Th2 response promoting infection in susceptible BALB/c mice.
