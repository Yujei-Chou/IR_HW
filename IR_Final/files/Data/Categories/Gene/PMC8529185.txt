Background: Amantadine has been proposed to inhibit E-channel conductance in reconstituted lipid bilayers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, we reported worsened memory and mood in both groups, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (Table 4).Older age and history of contact with COVID case were each associated with increased odds of COVID-19 in multivariable-adjusted models as follows: (OR: 1.048; 95% CI: 1.005, 1.092), (OR: 17.025; 95% CI 5.348, 54.199), respectively (Table 5).Amantadine was associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 disease infection after adjustment for several covariates, including age, sex, and other risk factors (adjusted OR 0.256, 95% CI 0.074-0.888). Another observational open-label study involving 15 patients supported the protective theory of amantadine, recently performed by Aranda-Abreu et al.,
