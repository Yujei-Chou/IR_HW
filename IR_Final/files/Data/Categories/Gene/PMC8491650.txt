SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that has caused a plethora of dysfunctions and changes in the human body. Patient was seen 1 month post SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis at which time she continued to endorse pain along her shoulder bilaterally, albeit not as severe in nature; NPRS was 6/10. However, it is plausible that long periods of bedrest (for example with prolonged hospitalization) or prolonged inactivity may lead to muscular overloads, atrophy or psychological stress and subsequently may lead to development of one or more palpable bands in which a latent myofascial trigger point could appear.
