Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is associated with systemic inflammation, endothelial activation, and multiorgan manifestations. Omega-3 fatty acid preparations are being evaluated in 4 ongoing RCTs for the treatment of COVID-19: KONS-COVID19 (Viruxal Oral and Nasal Spray for Treating the Symptoms of COVID-19), VASCEPA-COVID-19 (An Investigation on the Effects of Icosapent Ethyl [Vascepa] on Inflammatory Biomarkers in Individuals With COVID-1), PREPARE-IT 2 (Prevention of COVID19 With EPA in Healthcare Providers at Risk-Intervention Trial 2), and the COVID-19 Anosmia Study (NCT04495816).The KONS-COVID19 trial tests omega-3 inhaled use versus placebo among 128 outpatient participants. There are relatively few total numbers of patients enrolled in trials of omega-3 fatty acids for the management of COVID-19 (Figure 4).
