Evidence suggests that changes in alcohol consumption during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic were unevenly distributed over consumer groups. The estimated change in consumption by initial consumption levels followed the same pattern as in the main analysis (Figure S1B).We examined changes in alcohol consumption during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., April through June 2020) and found that across eight European countries, despite somewhat differing pandemic-related social restrictions, individual changes in alcohol consumption followed a similar pattern. The findings also suggest that the proportion of drinkers exceeding 28 units of alcohol per week increased from before to during the first months of the pandemic.
