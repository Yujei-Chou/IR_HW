Drive-through clinics have previously been utilized in vaccination efforts and are now being more widely adopted for COVID-19 vaccination in different parts of the world by offering many advantages including utilizing existing infrastructure, large daily throughput and enforcing social distancing by default. Simulations allowed the planning team to assess the overall performance of the drive-through clinic under different design scenarios and options. This paper reports the simulation of a real drive-through COVID-19 mass vaccination clinic and reported the outputs of two different potential layouts in terms of key performance indicators including the number of cars (patients) processed and total processing time.
