The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted clinical practice everywhere. By Fisher's exact test, there was a significant change in the overall distribution of tumors treated between period 1 (181 (48.7%) BCC, 185 (49.7%) SCC/SCCIS, and 6 (1.6%) other) and period 2 (79 (34.2%) BCC, 149 (64.5%) SCC/SCCIS, and 3 (1.3%) other) (p = 0.0018). The median number of days from initial biopsy to Mohs surgery was significantly reduced in period 2 compared to period 1 for total tumors (79 vs. 66, p = 0.0085) as well as the SCC/SCCIS subgroup (65 vs. 50, p = 0.0154).Our practice saw the total number of in-person visits decreased by greater than 50%, and Mohs surgeries by 38%, following declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic.
