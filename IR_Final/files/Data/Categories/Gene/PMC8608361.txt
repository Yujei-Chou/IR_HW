We aimed to examine the effect of a history of COVID-19 on myocardial ischemia in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients who presented with shortness of breath and/or chest pain after recovery. For this single-center retrospective study, patients who presented at cardiology outpatient clinics and had SPECT-MPI were screened. There was a 70% probability that the beta was greater than 0 (this indicated any degree of increase in the SSS) and a 24% probability that the beta was greater than 0.1 (this indicated a mild increase in the SSS).This is the first study to evaluate myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in COVID-19 patients who presented with chest pain and/or shortness of breath after recovery.
