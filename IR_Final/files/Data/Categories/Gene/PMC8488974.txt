The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. For instance, akin to medical imaging are the distinct multi-dimensional nature of 2D (e.g., CXRs) or 3D images (e.g., CT), relative or absolute quantitative nature, the different manufacturers or models of image acquisition systems or the different acquisition parameters (e.g., mAs and kVp) for a particular system, image reconstruction methods (e.g., analytical or iterative), the need for clinical expertise in annotation/truthing (as compared with crowdsourcing in natural image annotation), and the specific clinical context that needs to be considered part of the evaluation process. We recognize the great potential of imaging and AI in a variety of applications related to COVID-19 (such as those discussed in Sec.
