G-quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical nucleic acid structures involved in the regulation of key cellular processes, such as transcription and replication. NMM has been recently used in the analysis of 36 HCMV PQSs, which were associated with 20 genes. showed that all tested molecules inhibited SUD/G4 interaction, with IC50 values between 15 and 50 nM. The three most stable PQSs predicted in SARS-CoV-2 genome were also tested, but none of them interacted with the SUD domain, suggesting a preferential interaction with host cell DNA or RNA, rather than viral RNA.Additional G4 analysis in the SARS-CoV-2 genome also located a G-rich sequence in the viral nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) gene, which was shown to fold into RNA G4 and be further stabilized by the addition of the PDP ligand.
