Infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in many cases is accompanied by the release of a large amount of proinflammatory cytokines in an event known as "cytokine storm", which is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and high mortality. As shown, after LPS treatment, the mRNA expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1beta was higher than the mRNA expression of cytokines TNFalpha and IFNgamma, while preincubation with Tag7 peptide fragments resulted in a substantial decrease in the mRNA levels of studied cytokines (Figure 5).In view of the fact that the receptors TLR4, TREM-1 and TNFR1 might be expressed on monocytes initiating the onset of immune response, these findings were confirmed by the results of LPS incubation with isolated monocytes. All tested Tag7 peptides significantly decreased the level of plasma IL-4 after 3 or 10 h after DAD induction.
