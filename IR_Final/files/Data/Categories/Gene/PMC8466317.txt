Problematic Internet use (PIU) is a risk factor for psychological distress during COVID-19, as teachers are a psychologically vulnerable population. It is probable that the association between problematic Internet use behaviors and psychological distress may be even stronger during the COVID-19 pandemic, given the results of Chen et al. As such, from the perspective of SDT, the role of PNT of online teaching on teachers' mental health is critical, with results indicating that PNT of online teaching is both influenced by fear of COVID-19 and predicts psychological distress.
