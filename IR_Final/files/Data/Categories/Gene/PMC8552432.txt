COVID-19-associated-mucormycosis, commonly referred to as the "Black Fungus," is a rare secondary fungal infection in COVID-19 patients prompted by a group of mucor molds. Another key pathogenic strategy of SARS-CoV-2 that might ensure iron availability for R. oryzae pathogenesis is to attack the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin that initiates dissociation of porphyrins from iron and rapid discharge of elevated amounts of iron into circulation (Fig. Since free iron appears to play a significant role in encouraging fungal proliferation and growth, it is hypothesized that iron depletion or chelation therapy in COVID-19 patients might positively impact controlling this fungal infection.
