The need for virtual education for nursing staff has dramatically increased because of social distancing measures after the coronavirus disease pandemic. This curriculum was developed using Kern's model, engaged an established group of emergency educators involved in the international simulation collaborative group, Improving Pediatric Acute Care Through Simulation (ImPACTS, impactscollaborative.com), and focused on a high priority clinical topic area of pediatric status epilepticus (SE).The majority of acutely ill pediatric patients do not present to academic medical centers but to community emergency departments in the US, and 69% of those emergency departments see fewer than 15 children per day. Conducting a multicenter pediatric telesimulation for nursing staff in the community ED setting was feasible and well received by nurse learners.
