Vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent COVID-19. There is increasing interest in the study of breakthrough cases and limited data on patients who developed symptomatic COVID-19 requiring hospitalization after vaccination. To better understand vaccine breakthrough cases and their outcomes compared to unvaccinated COVID-19 cases, we analyzed and compared all consecutive patients, with or without prior vaccination, who were admitted to our hospital network due to COVID-19 from January to April 2021.We analyzed all consecutive adult hospitalized patients (>=18 years old) with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 and a positive RT-PCR who were admitted to Rhode Island Hospital (RIH), The Miriam Hospital, or Newport Hospital, in Rhode Island, between 1 January and 4 April 2021.
