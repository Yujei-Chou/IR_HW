The novel COVID-19 is a global pandemic disease overgrowing worldwide. Finally, the network with the original images also provides less COVID-19 identification performance as in the patch  (see in Fig. 10 and given 10.0% false-positive rates, the true-positive rates of COVID-19 identification from the baseline model, PRN, PRNA, PRNS, and PRNASCR are approximately 22.0%, 35.0%, 46.0%, 52.0%, and 67.0%, respectively, showing the improvements of 45.0% from the baseline 22.0%.Moreover, the experimental results from different experiments, such as baseline model, PRN, PRNA, PRNS, and PRNASCR, have been confirmed employing a statistical test called ANOVA and 5-fold cross-validation.
