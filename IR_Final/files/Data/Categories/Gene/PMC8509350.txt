We evaluated the impact of direct and indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). In this study, we evaluated the direct and indirect effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a cohort of FH subjects. In conclusion, a lower percentage of FH subjects underwent a lipid profile analysis, lipidologist and cardiologist consultations and vascular imaging evaluation after SARS-CoV-2 lockdown; moreover, reduced HDL-C and increased non-HDL-C were observed in FH subjects after SARS-CoV-2 lockdown, Finally, SARS-CoV-2-affected FH subjects exhibited an LDL-C beyond the recommended targets in concomitance with other cardiovascular risk factors; future prospective studies in a larger cohort of FH subjects are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.
