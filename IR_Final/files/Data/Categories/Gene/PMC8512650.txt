It is well accepted that environmental stressors experienced over a one's life, from microbial infections to chemical toxicants to even psychological stressors, ultimately shape central nervous system (CNS) functioning but can also contribute to its eventual breakdown. Ultimately however, it is important to consider how parallel changes in peripheral immunity and organ systems interact the central nervous system (CNS) in the context of repeated xenobiotic and pathogenic threats. Much recent attention has been devoted to the fact that some COVID19 patients displayed evidence of such a cytokine storm, with elevations in IL-2, G-CSF, IL-7, TNF-alpha along with the chemokines, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A. Likewise, a recent paper found IL-6 to be markedly elevated among SARS-COV2 infected patients and in fact, disease severity was correlated with circulating levels of this cytokine.
