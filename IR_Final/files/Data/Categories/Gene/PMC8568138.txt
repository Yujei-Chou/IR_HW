When emerging technologies transform an organization's way of working, explorative business process management (BPM) becomes a new challenge. Research novelty includes the development of an explorative framework for highlighting the factors and skills that can disrupt employees' attitude and work behavior. The TAM-related features of "perceived usefulness of explorative work changes" and "perceived ease-of-use of explorative work changes" have been positioned in the middle of Fig 1 to show a mediating role for increasing the effect of our exogenous latent constructs on "attitude towards future explorative work (i.e., after the COVID-19 lockdowns)" and "attitude towards future explorative BPM skill development".
