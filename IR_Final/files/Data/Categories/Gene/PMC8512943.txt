Having a complaint of shortness of breath at admission was associated with a 29.5% lower rate of achieving target of off oxygen therapy compared to those patients with no such complaint on admission (HR= 0.71, 95% CI=0.52, 0.96, p-value=0.026) (Table 3).The study aimed at assessing the duration of supplemental oxygen requirement and identifying its predictors. In conclusion, the average duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement among COVID-19 patients was 6 days.
