Peter Figueroa and co-authors advocate for equity in the worldwide provision of COVID-19 vaccines. While HICs contributed to the formation and funding of COVAX and the COVAX Facility responsible for equitable global access of COVID-19 vaccines, bilateral contracts with the pharmaceutical companies have monopolized most of the available vaccines. Based on the estimated 3 billion people who live in LMICs, this means the scale-up and manufacture of 6 billion doses, preferably during 2021.
