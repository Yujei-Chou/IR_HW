During the past two years, clinical studies have attempted to identify risk factors to predict clinical outcomes following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In August 2021, an international team of immunologists identified pre-existing autoantibodies to type 1 interferons (IFNs) in 10% of patients with severe COVID-19, but not in individuals with asymptomatic infection. Ongoing studies have identified a possible role for autoantibodies in the development of clinically severe COVID-19.
