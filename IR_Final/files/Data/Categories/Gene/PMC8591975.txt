Objective To describe the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the incidence of paediatric viral respiratory tract infection in Oxfordshire, UK. A median of 4.5 Influenza A/B/RSV PCRs/1,000 attendances were performed pre-pandemic, compared to 7.2/1,000 attendances during the pandemic (p = 0.95), a median of 3.9 Biofire multiplex PCR/1,000 attendances were performed pre-pandemic, compared to 16.7/1,000 attendances during the pandemic (p<0.0001). The first case of paediatric SARS-CoV-2 in this study was seen on 24-Mar-20, and in the period since the start of the pandemic it has accounted for 15% of respiratory viruses diagnosed in patients attending Paediatric ED.Pre-pandemic, seasonal peaks of RSV and influenza A/B were observed in September-February and December-March respectively, and to a lesser extent with hCoV in December-March.
