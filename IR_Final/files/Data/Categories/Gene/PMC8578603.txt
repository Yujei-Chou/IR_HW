The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the enforcement of national public health safety measures including precautionary behaviours such as border closures, movement restrictions, total or partial lockdowns, social distancing, and face mask mandates in order to reduce the spread of this disease. Games-Howell corrected pairwise comparisons indicate that perceived risk perception was significantly lower compared to both the perception of the necessity for public health measures (p < 0.0001), and perceived adherence to public health measures (p < 0.0001). Games-Howell corrected pairwise comparisons indicate that the proportion of unpleasant responses differed between the COVID-19 and pleasant categories (p < 0.0001), the COVID-19 and unpleasant categories (p < 0.0001) and the pleasant and unpleasant categories (p < 0.0001).
