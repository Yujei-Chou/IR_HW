The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has renewed interest in human coronaviruses that cause the common cold, particularly as research with them at biosafety level (BSL)-2 avoids the added costs and biosafety concerns that accompany work with SARS-CoV-2, BSL-3 research. Additionally, we optimized the antibody volumes by comparing 100 muL to 50 muL per well and reduced secondary antibody incubation time by comparing the signal from a two-hour incubation to a 30-minute incubation (manufacturer's recommendation).Cells were seeded in four T25 flasks of each cell line (HRT-18, MRC-5, Vero E6) and incubated at 37  C, 5 % CO2 until 95-100 % confluent. Our comparison of growth parameters of HCoV-OC43 propagation in three cell lines (HRT-18, MRC-5 and Vero E6) found that HCoV-OC43 propagated in MRC-5 cells achieved a higher titer (~7.0 log10 PFU/mL) that peaked at 2 dpi compared to that in HRT-18 cells (6.5 log10 TCID50/mL at 6 dpi).
