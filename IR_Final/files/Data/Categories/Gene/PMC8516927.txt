Dual-labeled PNA probe used RT-LAMP molecular rapid assay targeting SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and N genes was developed, and the analytical, clinical performances for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA extracted from clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens were evaluated in this study. The above results showed that PNA RT-LAMP assay employs high enough analytical specificity as well as the clinical performances are comparable to the gold standard real-time PCR method. Clinical accuracies were calculated by using the standard method in the base of CI 95%.RNA extracts were tested with five (5) individual extraction replicates on the PNA RT-LAMP assay, SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR assay U-TOP COVID-19 Detection Kit (SS-9930, Seasun Biomaterials) targets ORF1an/RdRp and N gene of SARS-CoV-2 with human RNase P in a single tube; and SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Colorimetric LAMP Assay Kit (E2019S, NEB) targets SARS-CoV-2 E/N genes in one tube, and rActin in a separate tube for the quality control according to the instructions provided from the manufacturers.
