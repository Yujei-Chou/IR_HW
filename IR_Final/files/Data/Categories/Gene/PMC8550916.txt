Background
Despite the UK being the first country to start nationwide vaccination campaigns, the emergence of the alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of concern drove the severe second wave over the 2020-21 winter leading to a third lockdown in England from Jan 5, 2021. For these forward projections, we accounted for the effect of school holidays on transmission (except July 23-Sept 1, which overlaps with the period directly after step four where we assume a gradual increase in contacts) and seasonality in SARS-CoV-2 transmission (for full model description and data sources see appendix pp 3-6).In our model fitting and forward projections (note that in our forward projections, our central projected trend is the median across all daily projections and is not a single trajectory), we explored plausible ranges of key epidemiological characteristics of delta. In this context, delta's high transmissibility means that population immunity, whether vaccine induced or infection induced, is insufficient to keep R t eff below one.
