LianHuaQingWen (LHQW) improves clinical symptoms and alleviates the severity of COVID-19, but the mechanism is unclear. and wogonin (Forsythiae Fructus) are all connected with the core target IL6, indicating that the effect of LHQW on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is closely related to these three active ingredients (Figure 4B).Protein-protein docking between COVID-19-Spike and IL6 receptor (IL6R)/IL6/IL6 receptor subunit beta (IL6ST) was simulated to verify whether IL6, the core target identified through our network pharmacology-based approach, was a pathogenic target. This analysis showed that the CDOCKER interaction energy levels of the 1P9M-6VXX complex with quercetin, luteolin, and wogonin based on this binding model were -34.5920 kcal mol-1, -32.8415 kcal mol-1, and -30.5083 kcal mol-1, respectively.
