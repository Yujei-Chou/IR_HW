Introduction
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, travellers were predominantly under- or uninsured for their travel. Accordingly, pandemic and known event exclusions, due to their wide application, can shift perceptions of the value of travel insurance and cause a reverse moral hazard problem in the market. Idiosyncratic events such as theft or lost property are attributable to personal traveller circumstances and are diversifiable by the insurer.
