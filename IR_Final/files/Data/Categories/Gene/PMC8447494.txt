Double stranded RNA is generated during viral replication. Treatment with 12 mg/kg Amersham poly I:C produced significantly greater induction of all three pro-inflammatory cytokines than treatment with 12 mg/kg Sigma poly I:C. One-way ANOVA showed a significant difference between treatment groups for IFN-beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha (F >= 11.67, df2,15, p <= 0.0009). HMW poly I:C at doses of 20 mg/kg produced systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that were much greater than those induced by low molecular weight poly I:C (Fig.
