This paper constructs a partial equilibrium model under public health emergency shocks based on economic growth theory, and investigates the relationship between government intervention and virus transmission and economic growth path. Based on the government's isolation and tracing measures, the epidemic will affect economic production by weakening the number and quality of labor. We use the data of the COVID-19 as a benchmark to simulate the relationship between the virus transmission capacity R0, per capita capital k, and economic growth path y, and policy (epsilonI, epsilonT), so as to find the changing path of the virus transmission capacity and the growth path of per capita capital and economic growth path under different intensity of government intervention policies.
