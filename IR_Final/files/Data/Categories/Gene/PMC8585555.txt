Background:The recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for efficacious virucidal products to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. And several recent studies have performed the in vitro evaluation of disinfection effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 suggested that alcohol-based disinfectants such as ethanol and isopropanol, and some alcohol-free hand sanitizer and UV light are really effective against SARS-CoV-2.Nevertheless, the disinfection data for SARS-CoV-2 are still limited as a novel virus and a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) agent. We wonder how about their virucidal activity after these QAC disinfectants are diluted and kept for a period of time at RT.
