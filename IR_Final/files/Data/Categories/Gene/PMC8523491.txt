Consumers' compliance with recommended behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic helps contain the spread of the virus and positively impacts marketplace outcomes. Based on these findings, we postulate a mediation hypothesis, similar to the one on compliance with recommended behavior; TU is negatively associated with consumers' concern about COVID-19, and COVID-19 concern, in turn, is positively associated with panic buying intentions (H2).Mindfulness is "one's complete attention to the experiences occurring in the present moment, in a nonjudgmental or accepting way" (, p. 27). In this research, we investigated the indirect effect of consumers' TU on their compliance with recommended behavior, and their panic buying intentions.
