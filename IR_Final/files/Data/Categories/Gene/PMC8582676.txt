Aim: This study aims to assess the influence of training on nurses' attitudes toward end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic alarm state in Spain. The same applies to the items "Caring for patients at the end-of-life is depressing" (item 7) with a percentage of strongly disagreeing at 49.7% of those who had training compared to 25.5% of those who did not (p = 0.001), and "I am afraid of having to deal with the emotional stress of relatives after the death of the patient" with 35.7% compared to 20.5% (p = 0.011).The training of the nurses in the sample is in line with previous studies on palliative care training in our country, in which only half of the nurses receive such training in their university degree program. The results showed a positive attitude toward end-of-life care as in other studies, despite the pandemic situation.
