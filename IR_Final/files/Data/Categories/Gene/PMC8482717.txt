The global pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has presented newfound challenges to the oncology community regarding management of disease progression in immunocompromised and cancer patients. While it is known that cancer patients have a higher risk of developing infections due to their immunocompromised state and anti-cancer therapy, previous reports of COVID-19 cases in cancer patients have provided little knowledge regarding the associations between cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients due to limitations in long-term follow-up. This study highlighted the importance of enacting proper isolation protocols to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to the high frequency of hospital visits by patients with cancer.
