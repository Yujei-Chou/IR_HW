Graphical abstract
The importance of cost-effective, portable, rapid and specific diagnostic devices for detection of infectious agents has well proven in the current COVID-19 pandemic. 1 The present review discussed the currently available MIPs-based electrochemical nanosensors for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The experimental data indicated that the developed sensor could be used for the analysis of the real sample where all other interfering proteins will be present.
