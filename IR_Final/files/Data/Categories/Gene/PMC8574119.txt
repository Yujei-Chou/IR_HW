It is not possible to establish causality as even through all patients tested negative for COVID-19 on RT PCR test at the time of the PVT diagnosis, 4 of them had prior COVID-19 illness, some of the others who were subsequently vaccinated may have had undiagnosed subclinical COVID-19 infection in the past.
