Background: Liver involvement in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognised. In multivariate analysis FAST > 0.36 (OR 3.19, p = 0.036), 4CMS (OR 1.68, p = 0.002) and HFNC (OR 7.03, p = 0.001) were independent predictors of adverse composite outcome. FAST score was not significantly associated with the severity of clinical presentation of COVID-19 as defined by 4CMS or HFNC oxygen supplementation (p > 0.05).When analysed as a continuous variable, higher FAST score was significantly associated with the need for MV (median 0.4 vs. 0.29 in patients with and without MV use, p = 0.046) but no significant association with death or composite outcome of MV or death was present (p > 0.05 for both analyses).
