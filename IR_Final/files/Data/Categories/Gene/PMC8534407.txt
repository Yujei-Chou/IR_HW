To date, little is known regarding the transmission risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection for subjects involved in handling, transporting, and examining deceased persons with known or suspected COVID-19 positivity at the time of death. Before death, all nasopharyngeal swabs collected from the subjects enrolled in the present study tested positive at the COVID-19 rRT-PCR assay. It should be pointed out that this time range can undoubtedly be lower, considering that only one sample tested positive, in the case of an autopsy performed after 12 h, and with the corpse stored at 0  C. Several studies have reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in cadavers; however, it is well known that the detection of viral RNA does not indicate that the body is necessarily infectious.
