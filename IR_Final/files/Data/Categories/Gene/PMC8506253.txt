Dear Editor,
Dear Editor,We found that the publication on "COVID-19 and smoking: A systematic review of the evidence" is very interesting. Vardavas and Nikitara noted that "smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19." We would like to share ideas on this specific issue on COVID-19 and smoking.
