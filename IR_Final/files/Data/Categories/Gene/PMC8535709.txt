This study aimed to summarize the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 from Western Mexico people during 2020. The higher proportion distribution of people assisting the diagnosis center was between 20 and 59 years old (Figure 1). However, when we evaluated the proportion according to the presence of any symptoms by positive/negative RT-PCR results, we observed a higher proportion of positive patients presenting symptoms compared to those negatives (92.3% vs. 78.4%; p < 0.001; data not shown).People visiting the sentinel center for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis manifested COVID-19 related symptomatology or contact with a current infected patient.
