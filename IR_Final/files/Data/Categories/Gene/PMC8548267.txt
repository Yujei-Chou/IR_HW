Intentional recovery communities, such as Clubhouses, exist as physical spaces for individuals living with Serious and Persistent Mental Illness. The following hypotheses were addressed: (1) members in the high Clubhouse engagement group will report significantly higher physical and mental health ratings over time than those in the low Clubhouse engagement group, and (2) members who reported contacting peers/members during building closures will report higher physical and mental health ratings over time than those who did not contact other peers/members. T-tests were conducted to examine whether participants' physical and mental health ratings differed significantly based on member characteristics such as gender and race/ethnicity.
