The escalation of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has required the development of safe and effective vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of the disease. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk/0.3% TBS-Tween20 at 4  C for 1 h and then probed with primary antibodies against GFP (1:1000 dilution; cat.ab290, AbCam, Cambridge, UK) or beta-Actin (1:6000 dilution; cat. Emerging studies including the serological level of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in response to the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine have suggested that individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 have naturally acquired an immunity and thus, proposed alternative approaches for the vaccination of former COVID-19 patients.
