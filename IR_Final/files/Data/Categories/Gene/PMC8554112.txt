The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruptions to many industries, and the transportation industry is among the most disrupted ones. From the above analysis, we conclude that our instrumental variables can solve the endogeneity issue in Equation (1) using 2SLS. We first look at whether drivers' sociodemographic characteristics moderate the impact of COVID-19 using Equation (3): where similar to Equation (1),  is the driver's labor supply measure for driver i, in city j, on day t.  is the lagged number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases in city j on day t.  is a measure of driver characteristics, including years of working experience at the focal company, premium status at the focal company (i.e., whether the driver is certified as a "gold driver" 11), number of requests prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and years of driving experience.
