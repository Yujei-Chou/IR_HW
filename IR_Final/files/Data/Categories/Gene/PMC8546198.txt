Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) also named COVID-19, aggressively spread all over the world in just a few months. aggregated high-level features using parallel partial decoder and presented semi-supervised lung infection segmentation deep network (Inf-Net) for segmentation of infected regions from CT images. In earlier work, scaling up the ConvNets is widely explored and comparatively achieved better accuracy.
