The National Academy of Medicine of Korea (NAMOK), established in 2004, is a non-profit organization involving erudite scholars belonging to medicine and health systems science that aims to improve public health by advancing medicine; leading modernization; and providing trusted, authoritative, and scientific advice to the government and Korean population. As discussed in the short-term pending issues, the capacity to perform infectious disease diagnostic tests needs to be expanded.
