Since the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic started, children and young adults have seldom been placed in high-risk groups, despite reports that they are at increased risk of severe forms of the disease and death in the presence of comorbidities. Despite complete COVID-19 protocols being initiated, the patient's condition steadily deteriorated, with the development of hypoxia (oxygen saturation 80%). These included the well-established presence of multinucleated interalveolar cells, type two pneumocyte hyperplasia, as well as endotheliitis, with subendothelial deposits in the vascular walls and vascular wall degeneration as seen in Figures 1 and 2.Other non-COVID-19-associated inflammatory changes in the pulmonary parenchyma were foci of purulent bronchitis and pulmonary foreign bodies, with granuloma formation (Figure 3).
