Public health measures applied exclusively within vulnerable populations have been suggested as an alternative to community-wide interventions to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These models have therefore proven useful to evaluate the impact of public health interventions and policy measures on disease transmission, particularly for response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, although vaccinated individuals benefited from fewer hospitalizations and ICU admissions, the cumulative deaths in this age group were nonetheless amplified in most vaccine scenarios compared with the benchmark scenario; this results from the overflow of younger individuals into hospitals in the model, leading to an increased mortality rate in hospitalized and ICU patients when the corresponding beds were overcapacity (electronic supplementary material, table S5 in ESM1) reflecting the healthcare system's inability to treat all patients.
