PURPOSE
The current COVID-19 global pandemic, caused by the novel beta-coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2, has spurred on the implementation of containment measures such as quarantine, self-isolation, and physical distancing across the country, including in healthcare settings, in an attempt to stem the spread. The majority of providers indicated that their experience with telemedicine would be improved by the use of video-enabled telemedicine as opposed to a telephone call (n = 20; 80%) and better infrastructure (eg, private office, headset, etc; n = 11; 44%; Fig 2).Providers most commonly indicated that telemedicine should become part of regular practice (n = 17; 66%); follow-up appointments for patients on surveillance were indicated as suitable (n = 24; 96%) along with follow-up appointments for patients on stable doses of oral anticancer treatments (n = 14; 56%). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of patients were opposed to receiving bad news from imaging results via telemedicine.
