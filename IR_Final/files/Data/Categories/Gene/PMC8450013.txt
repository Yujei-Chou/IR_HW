Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) belonging to the genus beta coronavirus has emerged as a global threat and a significant public health issue. The study participants were included from specialties who are involved in airway management during their routine practice. The mean knowledge assessment score increased from 6.0 to 8.9 after the course (P = 0.001), and the practical skills scores increased from 22.8 to 27.0 (P = 0.03).Even though the baseline level of knowledge of HCWs was significantly higher in the anesthesia group as compared to the non-anesthesia group, the improvement in score was significantly more in the latter group, thus highlighting the effectiveness and utility of such training, especially in non-anesthesia workers who are not conventionally trained in airway management.
