We aimed to investigate whether coronavirus disease (COVID-19) survivors were at a higher risk of dementia diagnosis compared to controls at 6 months follow-up. Additionally, we performed a multivariable Cox regression analysis after excluding 8 patients in the control group who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between 4 June 2020 to 1 December 2020. The following are available online at , Table S1: The ICD-10 codes used by comorbidity to compute the Charlson comorbidity index, Table S2: The clinico-epidemiological characteristics of all the study participants (n=306,577), Table S3: Other variables in multivariable model 1 from Table 2, Table S4: The comparison of the clinicopathological characteristics between COVID-19 survivors and the control population after excluding test-negative individuals.
