Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) commonly complicates with coagulopathy. The FXa is known to strongly promote inflammation as the consequence of increased cytokine expression. The pathophysiology of DIC in our patient is likely to be related to both SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1) and the presence of antiplatelet antibodies (Figure 3).The choice to treat the patient with rivaroxaban derives primarily from the absolute contraindication to the use of heparins; AVKs have a slow onset of anticoagulant effects and require continuous monitoring of INR; for dabigatran, apixaban, and edoxaban, evidence of efficacy in ill patients is lacking; for rivaroxaban there is evidence of a reduction in fatal and major thromboembolic events in medically ill patients.
