Background
Since the declaration of the global COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization and since measures of social isolation have been in place in many countries, including Canada, dreams have been a hot topic of conversation. A separate ANOVA revealed that sleep duration decreased significantly as stress levels increased, and the frequency of all three dream recall variables increased as stress increased (Table 2).Weekly dream recall: Tukey post-hoc comparisons revealed significant differences between low and severe stress groups (mean difference = .762; p = .003), and medium and severe stress groups (mean difference = .579; p = .038).
