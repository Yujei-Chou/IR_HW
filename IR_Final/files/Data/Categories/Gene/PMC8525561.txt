ABSTRACT
Emerging data on the serological response following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suggest that most individuals have detectable antibody levels at late stages of infection (3 to 4 weeks after acute onset). These findings might suggest that (i) the presence of IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 should be interpreted carefully on the basis of the specific clinical and epidemiological scenario, (ii) the seroprevalence surveys may underestimate the true nature and the extent of the population's exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and (iii) stringent thresholds applied in SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays may lead to underdetection of asymptomatic or mild infections, but if assay thresholds are lowered to improve sensitivity, this might also result in reduced specificity. Further large-scale prospective longitudinal studies are needed to determine the longevity of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 as a surrogate of individual protection against reinfection after natural infection and vaccination.
