As the early COVID-19 outbreak sparked xenophobia against people of Asian and Chinese background, we collected data from Chinese migrants worldwide to test how discrimination at a macro-level was perceived by the Chinese during COVID-19 globally. Following this rationale, we first askRQ1: Were the Chinese migrants abroad aware of discrimination against co-nationals in other countries during COVID-19? Synthesizing results from our analyses in addressing the three research questions, we found that: (1) During COVID-19, overseas Chinese migrants were aware of discrimination against co-nationals from several sources of information (see S3 Fig in S1 File for detail), whereas only the tendency to report learning discrimination messages from traditional media was correlated with anger and national identity.
