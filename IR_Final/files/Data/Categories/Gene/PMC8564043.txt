Background
Suicide is preventable, yet annually, approximately 800 000 people die of suicide worldwide (World Health Organization,). Most studies found that the completed suicide rate before and during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave was unchanged (Faust et al.,; Comparison of suicide rates between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative cases for the exposure period showed a null (p > 0.05) difference in proportions between the two groups [difference = 10-5 (0.36), 95% CI 10-5 (-2.54 to 3.26), p-value = 1.00].We leveraged epidemiological data implemented a quasi-experimental design with national coverage spanning seven years before the COVID-19 pandemic, a year of the COVID-19 pandemic, information about the three lockdown intervals, and COVID-19 infection status to test for an effect on the rate of severe attempted suicide.
