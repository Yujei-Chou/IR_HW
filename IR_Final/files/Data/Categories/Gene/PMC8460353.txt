Structure-based antiviral developments in the past two years have been dominated by the structure determination and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and new lead molecules for picornaviruses. ACE2 glycosylation was shown to be important in its affinity for S. Co-receptors include transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and neuropilin binding the cleaved S.All newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have amino acids changes that are being monitored in the S protein RBD (https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/ accessed 10th August 2021). mapped the spike protein glycans looking for unshielded epitopes using molecular simulations.
