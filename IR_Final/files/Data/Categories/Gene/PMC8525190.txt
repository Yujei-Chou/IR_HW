In this exploratory study, we polled over 500 participants from the United States on April 8, 2020:during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when the practice of social distancing was at its peak. For descriptive purposes, we also asked participants to estimate the overall percentage (0%-100%) of their social interactions that took place online versus in-person during the past week. But unlike in-person interactions with weak ties, online interactions with weak ties were also associated with more negative affect, r = 0.18, p < .001, and decreased social connectedness, r = -0.16, p < .001.Overall, consistent with past research, in-person interactions were related to higher well-being outcomes across both positive and negative indicators.
