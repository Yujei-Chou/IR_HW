Background
Health-care-associated infections represent an enduring and serious threat to patient safety, and are estimated to cost the National Health Service (NHS) $1 billion each year. General medical (RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.46) and geriatric admissions (RR = 1.35, 95% CI: 0.40 to 4.64) were also suggestive of an increased risk of mortality with nosocomial COVID-19 but did not reach statistical significance (p=0.360 and 0.629, respectively).Critical care admission rates were reported in 8 studies reporting nosocomial outbreaks; with a crude rate of 27/252 (10.7%) in patients with nosocomial COVID-19 compared to 359/1396 (25.7%) in those hospitalised with community-acquired COVID-19. Examination of linked primary care and mortality data within the United Kingdom suggests that COVID-19 amplifies the risk of death by a factor associated with the levels of circulating virus and an individuals' underlying diagnoses.
