Recently, and considering the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing consensus that the disinfection of surfaces contaminated with pathogenic viral particles is essential. From the point of view of false-positive outcomes caused by the nonspecific amplification of inactivated and infectious viruses, the RT-qPCR assay produced cycle threshold (Ct) values for both Hu-NoV GI.6 and GII.4 after treatment with SAEW (ORP of 1123 mV, pH of 5.12, and ACC of 33.22 ppm), and both Hu-NoVs were amplified at a value of approximately 40 Ct by MBS/PMA/SLS/RT-qPCR (Figure S4).
