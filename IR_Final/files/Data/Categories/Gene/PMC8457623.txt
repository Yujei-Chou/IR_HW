Cities are centres of innovation and wealth creation, but also hotspots of air pollution and noise, heat island effects and lack of green space, which are all detrimental to human health. Making cities 30% more compact and thereby increasing density and land use, reducing travel distances, increasing public and active transportation could avoid around 400-800 DALYs per 100,000 people with respect to diabetes, CVD, and respiratory disease annually, depending on the type of city Sprawled cities like Boston and Melbourne, where the transport mode share of cars is 80.1% and 85.1% respectively could improve health considerably by changes in land use and transport mode. Many cities have introduced different policies that aim to reduce motorized traffic including implementing car free days.
