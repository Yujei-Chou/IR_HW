Surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 variants including the quickly spreading mutants by rapid and near real-time sequencing of the viral genome provides an important tool for effective health policy decision making in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Additional sequencing runs (UKBA-6, UKBA-10, UKBA-11, and UKBA-12) were performed with long 2-kb amplicons on standard MinION flow cells with similar results (Fig 2A; S2 Fig).To investigate if a different primer scheme for generating long amplicons can solve the problem with uneven coverage (in particular, see amplicon 13 in Fig 4 which partially covers the S gene region important for identification of the SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concerns), we also tested the 2.5-kb primer panel.
