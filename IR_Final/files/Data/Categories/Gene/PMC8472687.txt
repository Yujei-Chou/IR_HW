During the recent pandemic, the fact that the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 may be indistinguishable from bacterial infection, as well as concerns of bacterial co-infection, have been associated with an increased use of antibiotics. The proportion of patients who received at least one antibiotic was significantly lower in COVID-19 departments compared to equivalent departments in 2018 and 2019 (Wave 2: 30.2% vs. 45.6% and 44.9%, respectively; Wave 3: 30.5% vs. 47.8% and 50.1%, respectively, p < 0.001). The median time from hospitalization to start of the antibiotic treatment was 27 h (IQR 14.6-124.6 h), and the median duration of treatment was 5 days (IQR 2-8 days).The proportion of patients who received antibiotics was significantly lower during the second and third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the proportion of patients who received antibiotics in the equivalent departments during the same calendar months of 2018 and 2019 (Wave 2: 30.2% vs. 45.6% and 44.9% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
