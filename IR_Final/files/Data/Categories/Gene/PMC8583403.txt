(1) Background: In their efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, most countries closed schools and kindergartens. Regarding financial burdens, 21% (n = 780) found their families highly burdened, while only 2% claimed that this was the case prior to the pandemic (n = 58) (Table 4).Regarding their children, the overall (physical and psychological) burden during lockdown followed a noticeable age-gradient; the older the children, the higher their burden and the lower their wellbeing as assessed by the parent:while at the same time parents have to fall back on less exhausting strategies (e.g., working during early/late hours; Table 5). Our study indicates that other contacts, such as relatives, friends, and neighbors, were activated throughout the lockdown.
