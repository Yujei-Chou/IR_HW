Introduction
Omalizumab (Xolair ) is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody used as adjunctive therapy in the management of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and moderate-to-severe allergic asthma . The British Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) published recommendations relating to home therapy included expediting home self-administration pathways and extra-license usage of home self-administration in patients with a history of anaphylaxis which had a clear trigger unrelated to omalizumab . Zero out of 39 (0%) attended experienced anaphylaxis triggered by omalizumab.
