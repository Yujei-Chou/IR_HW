Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory viral infection. Haplotype analysis revealed a significantly increased frequency of the haplotype G-C-A-T-T-A (in the order: rs3811042, rs3811043, rs2466449, rs3811045, rs3811046 and rs3811047) in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (0.055 vs. 0.006; OR = 10.23; 95% CI = 1.53-68.14; p = 0.003; pc = 0.03). Conversely, the G-A-C-T-G haplotype showed a lower frequency in patients than in controls, but the pc-value was not significant (0.126 vs. 0.204; OR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.33-1.01; p = 0.05; pc = 0.5) (Table 2 ).Although cytokines have been implicated in initiating anti-viral immune responses and involved in virus-mediated pathogenesis, host genetic variations may influence their responses to respiratory viral infections.
