0,Field evaluation of a rapid antigen test (Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device) for COVID-19 diagnosis in primary healthcare centres.,"Objectives: To our knowledge no previous study has assessed the performance of a rapid antigen diagnostic immunoassay (RAD) conducted at the point of care (POC). We evaluated the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device for diagnosis of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in symptomatic patients (n = 412) attending primary healthcare centres. Methods: RAD was performed immediately after sampling following the manufacturer's instructions (reading at 15 min). RT-PCRs were carried out within 24 h of specimen collection. Samples displaying discordant results were processed for culture in Vero E6 cells. Presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in cell cultures was confirmed by RT-PCR. Results: Out of 412 patients, 43 (10.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR and RAD, and 358 (86.9%) tested negative by both methods; discordant results (RT-PCR+/RAD-) were obtained in 11 patients (2.7%). Overall specificity and sensitivity of rapid antigen detection (RAD) was 100% (95%CI 98.7-100%) and 79.6% (95%CI 67.0-88.8%), respectively, taking RT-PCR as the reference. Overall RAD negative predictive value for an estimated prevalence of 5% and 10% was 99% (95%CI 97.4-99.6%) and 97.9% (95%CI 95.9-98.9), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 could not be cultured from specimens yielding RT-PCR+/RAD- results (n = 11). Conclusion: The Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device performed well as a POC test for early diagnosis of COVID-19 in primary healthcare centres. More crucially, the data suggested that patients with RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 testing negative by RAD are unlikely to be infectious."
1,Detection technologies and recent developments in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 capable of causing mild to severe infections in humans. Since its first appearance in China in December 2019, the pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. Despite considerable efforts made to contain the disease, the virus has continued its prevalence in many countries with varying degrees of clinical manifestations. To contain this pandemic, collaborative approach involving accurate diagnosis, epidemiology, surveillance, and prophylaxis is essential. However, proper diagnosis using rapid technologies plays a crucial role. With increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases, the accurate and early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 is need of the hour for effective prevention and management of COVID-19 cases as well as to curb its spread. RT-qPCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for the early detection of virus, but this protocol has limited application to use as bedside test because of its technical complexity. To address these challenges, several POC assays have been developed to facilitate the COVID-19 diagnosis outside the centralized testing laboratories as well to accelerate the clinical decision making with a least turnaround time. Hence, in this report, we review different nucleic acid-based and serological techniques available for the diagnosis and effective prevention of COVID-19. KEY POINTS : • Provides comprehensive information on the different diagnostic tools available for COVID-19 • Nucleic acid based tests or antigen detection tests are used for diagnostic purpose • Accurate diagnosis is essential for the efficient management of COVID-19."
2,Benefits and limitations of serological assays in COVID-19 infection.,"Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests are critical for achieving control of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a pandemic illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, point-of-care tests. The pace of development has, however, exceeded that of rigorous evaluation, and important uncertainty about test accuracy remains."
3,Effectiveness of COVID-19 diagnosis and management tools: A review.,"Objective: To review the available literature concerning the effectiveness of the COVID-19 diagnostic tools. Background: With the absence of specific treatment/vaccines for the coronavirus COVID-19, the most appropriate approach to control this infection is to quarantine people and isolate symptomatic people and suspected or infected cases. Although real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is considered the first tool to make a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, the high false negative rate, low sensitivity, limited supplies and strict requirements for laboratory settings might delay accurate diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) has been reported as an important tool to identify and investigate suspected patients with COVID-19 disease at early stage. Key findings: RT-PCR shows low sensitivity (60-71%) in diagnosing patients with COVID-19 infection compared to the CT chest. Several studies reported that chest CT scans show typical imaging features in all patients with COVID-19. This high sensitivity and initial presentation in CT chest can be helpful in rectifying false negative results obtained from RT-PCR. As COVID-19 has similar manifestations to other pneumonia diseases, artificial intelligence (AI) might help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases. Conclusion: Although CT scan is a powerful tool in COVID-19 diagnosis, it is not sufficient to detect COVID-19 alone due to the low specificity (25%), and challenges that radiologists might face in differentiating COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia on chest CT scans. AI might help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases. Implication for practice: Both RT-PCR and CT tests together would increase sensitivity and improve quarantine efficacy, an impact neither could achieve alone."
4,False-negative results of initial RT-PCR assays for COVID-19: A systematic review.,"Background: A false-negative case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is defined as a person with suspected infection and an initial negative result by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, with a positive result on a subsequent test. False-negative cases have important implications for isolation and risk of transmission of infected people and for the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to review and critically appraise evidence about the rate of RT-PCR false-negatives at initial testing for COVID-19. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, as well as COVID-19 repositories, including the EPPI-Centre living systematic map of evidence about COVID-19 and the Coronavirus Open Access Project living evidence database. Two authors independently screened and selected studies according to the eligibility criteria and collected data from the included studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We calculated the proportion of false-negative test results using a multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model. The certainty of the evidence about false-negative cases was rated using the GRADE approach for tests and strategies. All information in this article is current up to July 17, 2020. Results: We included 34 studies enrolling 12,057 COVID-19 confirmed cases. All studies were affected by several risks of bias and applicability concerns. The pooled estimate of false-negative proportion was highly affected by unexplained heterogeneity (tau-squared = 1.39; 90% prediction interval from 0.02 to 0.54). The certainty of the evidence was judged as very low due to the risk of bias, indirectness, and inconsistency issues. Conclusions: There is substantial and largely unexplained heterogeneity in the proportion of false-negative RT-PCR results. The collected evidence has several limitations, including risk of bias issues, high heterogeneity, and concerns about its applicability. Nonetheless, our findings reinforce the need for repeated testing in patients with suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 infection given that up to 54% of COVID-19 patients may have an initial false-negative RT-PCR (very low certainty of evidence).

5,COVID-19 - Recent advancements in identifying novel vaccine candidates and current status of upcoming SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly. To date, countries have relied on the prevention of the disease through isolation, quarantine, and clinical care of affected individuals. However, studies on the roles of asymptomatic and mildly infected subjects in disease transmission, use of antiviral drugs, and vaccination of the general population will be very important for mitigating the effects of the eventual return of this pandemic. Initial investigations are ongoing to evaluate antigenic structures of SARS-CoV-2 and the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates. There also is a need to comprehensively compile the details of previous studies on SARS-related vaccines that can be extrapolated to identify potent vaccine targets for developing COVID-19 vaccines. This review aims to analyze previous studies, current status, and future possibilities for producing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines."
6,Systematic review with meta-analysis of the accuracy of diagnostic tests for COVID-19.,"Objective: To collate the evidence on the accuracy parameters of all available diagnostic methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed. Searches were conducted in Pubmed and Scopus (April 2020). Studies reporting data on sensitivity or specificity of diagnostic tests for COVID-19 using any human biological sample were included. Results: Sixteen studies were evaluated. Meta-analysis showed that computed tomography has high sensitivity (91.9% [89.8%-93.7%]), but low specificity (25.1% [21.0%-29.5%]). The combination of IgM and IgG antibodies demonstrated promising results for both parameters (84.5% [82.2%-86.6%]; 91.6% [86.0%-95.4%], respectively). For RT-PCR tests, rectal stools/swab, urine, and plasma were less sensitive while sputum (97.2% [90.3%-99.7%]) presented higher sensitivity for detecting the virus. Conclusions: RT-PCR remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in sputum samples. However, the combination of different diagnostic tests is highly recommended to achieve adequate sensitivity and specificity."
7,Should RT-PCR be considered a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19?,"To face the new Covid‐19 pandemic, the need for early and accurate diagnosis of the disease among suspected cases quickly became obvious for effective management, and for better control of the spread of the disease in the population. Since the beginning of this disease epidemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) has routinely been used to confirm diagnosis. However, several authors have pointed out the poor performance of this technique, particularly in terms of sensitivity.1,2 This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
8,Update in COVID-19 in the intensive care unit from the 2020 HELLENIC Athens International symposium.,"The 2020 International Web Scientific Event in COVID-19 pandemic in critically ill patients aimed at updating the information and knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic in the intensive care unit. Experts reviewed the latest literature relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in critically ill patients, such as epidemiology, pathophysiology, phenotypes of infection, COVID-19 as a systematic infection, molecular diagnosis, mechanical ventilation, thromboprophylaxis, COVID-19 associated co-infections, immunotherapy, plasma treatment, catheter-related bloodstream infections, artificial intelligence for COVID-19, and vaccination. Antiviral therapy and co-infections are out of the scope of this review. In this review, each of these issues is discussed with key messages regarding management and further research being presented after a brief review of available evidence."
9,Recent Developments on Therapeutic and Diagnostic Approaches for COVID-19.,"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made a serious public health threat worldwide with millions of people at risk in a growing number of countries. Though there are no clinically approved antiviral drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, attempts are ongoing for clinical trials of several known antiviral drugs, their combination, as well as development of vaccines in patients with confirmed COVID-19. This review focuses on the latest approaches to diagnostics and therapy of COVID-19. We have summarized recent progress on the conventional therapeutics such as antiviral drugs, vaccines, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody treatments, and convalescent plasma therapy which are currently under extensive research and clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The developments of nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic approaches have been also discussed for COVID-19. We have assessed recent literature data on this topic and made a summary of current development and future perspectives."
10,"Origin, transmission, diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Coronavirus has emerged as a global health threat due to its accelerated geographic spread over the last two decades. This article reviews the current state of knowledge concerning the origin, transmission, diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Historically, it has caused two pandemics: severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome followed by the present COVID-19 that emerged from China. The virus is believed to be acquired from zoonotic source and spreads through direct and contact transmission. The symptomatic phase manifests with fever, cough and myalgia to severe respiratory failure. The diagnosis is confirmed using reverse transcriptase PCR. Management of COVID-19 is mainly by supportive therapy along with mechanical ventilation in severe cases. Preventive strategies form the major role in reducing the public spread of virus along with successful disease isolation and community containment. Development of a vaccine to eliminate the virus from the host still remains an ongoing challenge."
11,COVID-19 diagnosis -A review of current methods.,"A fast and accurate self-testing tool for COVID-19 diagnosis has become a prerequisite to comprehend the exact number of cases worldwide and to take medical and governmental actions accordingly. SARS-CoV-2 (formerly, 2019-nCoV) infection was first reported in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, and then it has rapidly spread around the world, causing ~14 million active cases with ~582,000 deaths as of July 2020. The diagnosis tools available so far have been based on a) viral gene detection, b) human antibody detection, and c) viral antigen detection, among which the viral gene detection by RT-PCR has been found as the most reliable technique. In this report, the current SARS-CoV-2 detection kits, exclusively the ones that were issued an ""Emergency Use Authorization"" from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, were discussed. The key structural components of the virus were presented to provide the audience with an understanding of the scientific principles behind the testing tools. The methods that are still in the early research state were also reviewed in a subsection based on the reports available so far."
12,"COVID-19: Advances in diagnostic tools, treatment strategies, and vaccine development.","An unprecedented worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 has imposed severe challenges on healthcare facilities and medical infrastructure. The global research community faces urgent calls for the development of rapid diagnostic tools, effective treatment protocols, and most importantly, vaccines against the pathogen. Pooling together expertise across broad domains to innovate effective solutions is the need of the hour. With these requirements in mind, in this review, we provide detailed critical accounts on the leading efforts at developing diagnostics tools, therapeutic agents, and vaccine candidates. Importantly, we furnish the reader with a multidisciplinary perspective on how conventional methods like serology and RT-PCR, as well as cutting-edge technologies like CRISPR/Cas and artificial intelligence/machine learning, are being employed to inform and guide such investigations. We expect this narrative to serve a broad audience of both active and aspiring researchers in the field of biomedical sciences and engineering and help inspire radical new approaches towards effective detection, treatment, and prevention of this global pandemic."
13,Recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 in patients recovered from COVID-19.,"Recurrence of positive SARS CoV‐2 PCR has been described in patients discharged from hospital after 2 consecutive negative PCR. We discuss possible explanations including false negative, reactivation and re‐infection and propose different strategy to solve this issue. Prolonged SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA shedding and recurrence of viral RNA shedding in asymptomatic patients remain unknown. Transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 by asymptomatic carriers had been documented. Considering the significance of this ongoing global public health emergency, it is necessary to carry out large studies to better understand the issue of potential SARS‐CoV‐2 recurrence in COVID‐19 patients.

14,Integrated control of COVID-19 in resource-poor countries.,"Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face many challenges in controlling COVID-19. Healthcare resources are limited and so are ICU beds. RT-PCR testing is conducted on a limited scale and treatment options are few. There is no vaccine. Therefore, what low-cost solutions remain for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2? How should these essential health services be delivered in order to reach the most vulnerable in our societies? In this editorial we discuss several important strategies for controlling COVID-19 including: vaccination, molecular and serological diagnostics, hygiene and WaSH interventions, and low-cost therapeutics. We also discuss the delivery of such services in order to reach the most in need. The proposed integrated control strategy requires immediate action and political will in order to reduce the widening health inequalities caused by the pandemic."
15,Dynamics of viral load and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with positive RT-PCR results after recovery from COVID-19.,"Recently, the number of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who have tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), via the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, after recovery has increased; this has caused a dilemma regarding the medical measures and policies. We evaluated the dynamics of viral load and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in four patients with positive RT-PCR results after recovery. In all patients, the highest levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies were reached after about a month of the onset of the initial symptoms. Then, the IgG titers plateaued, and the IgM titers decreased, regardless of RT-PCR results. The IgG and IgM levels did not increase after the post-negative positive RT-PCR results in any of the patients. Our results reinforced that the post-negative positive RT-PCR results may be due to the detection of RNA particles rather than reinfection in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19."
16,COVID-19 Antibody Tests: A Valuable Public Health Tool with Limited Relevance to Individuals.,"Antibody tests for detecting past infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have many uses for public health decision making, but demand has largely come from individual consumers. This review focuses on the individual relevance of antibody tests: their accuracy in detecting prior infection, what past SARS-CoV-2 infection can currently infer about future immunity or possible medical sequelae, and the potential future importance of antibody tests for vaccine selection and medical screening. Given uncertainty about the antibody tests (quality, accuracy level, positive predictive value) and what those tests might indicate immunologically (durability of antibodies and necessity for protection from reinfection), seropositive test results should not be used to inform individual decision making, and antibody testing should remain a tool of public health at this time."
17,Identification of RT-PCR-Negative Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients via Serological Testing.,"Asymptomatic individuals with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been identified via nucleic acid testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, the epidemiologic characteristics and viral shedding pattern of asymptomatic patients remain largely unknown. In this study, serological testing was applied when identifying nine asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 who showed persistent negative RT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and no symptoms of COVID-19. Two asymptomatic cases were presumed to be index patients who had cleared the virus when their close contacts developed symptoms of COVID-19. Three of the asymptomatic cases were local individuals who spontaneously recovered before their presumed index patients developed symptoms of COVID-19. This report presents the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection that were undetected on RT-PCR tests in previous epidemiologic investigations probably due to the transient viral shedding duration."
18,COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients at the epicenter of pandemics.,"We investigated the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in recipients of kidney transplants in the Bronx, New York, one of the epicenters of the pandemic. Between March 16 and June 2, 2020, 132 kidney transplant recipients tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. From May 3 to July 29, 2020, 912 kidney transplant recipients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies during routine clinic visits, of which 16.6% tested positive. Fifty-five of the 152 patients had previously tested positive by RT-PCR, while the remaining 97 did not have significant symptoms and had not been previously tested by RT-PCR. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23.4% in the 975 patients tested by either RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Older patients and patients with higher serum creatinine levels were more likely diagnosed by RT-PCR compared to SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at a median of 44 days post-diagnosis (Inter Quartile Range 31-58) and 80% were positive. Overall mortality was 20.5% but significantly higher (37.8%) in the patients who required hospitalization. Twenty-three percent of the hospitalized patients required kidney replacement therapy and 6.3% lost their allografts. In multivariable analysis, older age, receipt of deceased-donor transplantation, lack of influenza vaccination in the previous year and higher serum interleukine-6 levels were associated with mortality. Thus, 42% of patients with a kidney transplant and with COVID-19 were diagnosed on antibody testing without significant clinical symptoms; 80% of patients with positive RT-PCR developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG and mortality was high among patients requiring hospitalization."
19,How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted PCR?,The recent pandemic has posed perhaps the biggest challenge for PCR to date. Is PCR likely to be replaced or will it continue to stand the test of time? [Formula: see text].
20,Discharged COVID-19 patients testing positive again for SARS-CoV-2 RNA: A minireview of published studies from China.,"In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, one potential cause of concern is that some discharged COVID-19 patients are testing positive again for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. To better understand what is happening and to provide public health policy planners and clinicians timely information, we have searched and reviewed published studies about discharged patients testing positive again for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in China. Our review of these reports indicates the presence of discharged patients who remain asymptomatic but test positive. However, it is unclear whether they are contagious because a positive reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) test does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and transmissible virus. Our review suggests the need for timely, parallel testing of different samples, including, for example, fecal specimens, from COVID-19 patients before and after they are discharged from hospitals."
21,Clinical sensitivity and interpretation of PCR and serological COVID-19 diagnostics for patients presenting to the hospital.,"The diagnosis of COVID-19 requires integration of clinical and laboratory data. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostic assays play a central role in diagnosis and have fixed technical performance metrics. Interpretation becomes challenging because the clinical sensitivity changes as the virus clears and the immune response emerges. Our goal was to examine the clinical sensitivity of two most common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test modalities, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology, over the disease course to provide insight into their clinical interpretation in patients presenting to the hospital. We conducted a single-center, retrospective study. To derive clinical sensitivity of PCR, we identified 209 PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients with multiple PCR test results (624 total PCR tests) and calculated daily sensitivity from date of symptom onset or first positive test. Clinical sensitivity of PCR decreased with days post symptom onset with >90% clinical sensitivity during the first 5 days after symptom onset, 70%-71% from Days 9 to 11, and 30% at Day 21. To calculate daily clinical sensitivity by serology, we utilized 157 PCR-positive patients with a total of 197 specimens tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In contrast to PCR, serological sensitivity increased with days post symptom onset with >50% of patients seropositive by at least one antibody isotype after Day 7, >80% after Day 12, and 100% by Day 21. Taken together, PCR and serology are complimentary modalities that require time-dependent interpretation. Superimposition of sensitivities over time indicate that serology can function as a reliable diagnostic aid indicating recent or prior infection."
22,Serologic Response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 Patients with Different Severity.,"The immense patient number caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic brings the urge for more knowledge about its immunological features, including the profile of basic immune parameters. In this study, eighty-eight reported COVID-19 patients in Wuhan were recruited from January to February, 2020, including 32 severe/critical cases and 56 mild/moderate cases. Their mean age was 56.43 years (range 17-83) and gender ratio (male/female) was 43:45. We tested SARS-CoV-2 RNA with commercial kits, investigated the level of serologic IgM and IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using magnetic particle chemiluminescence immunoassays, and compared the results of serologic tests and nucleic acid test (NAT). Among 88 patients, 95.45% were confirmed as positive by the combination of NAT and antibody test, which was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than by single nucleic acid test (73.86%) or serologic test (65.91%). Then the correlation between temporal profile and the level of antibody response was analyzed. It showed that seroconversion started on day 5 after disease onset and IgG level was rose earlier than IgM. Comparison between patients with different disease severity suggested early seroconversion and high antibody titer were linked with less severe clinical symptoms. These results supported the combination of serologic testing and NAT in routine COVID-19 diagnosis and provided evidence on the temporal profile of antibody response in patients with different disease severity."
23,SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among health care workers in a New York City hospital: A cross-sectional analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Background: New York City (NYC) has endured the greatest burden of COVID-19 infections in the US. Health inequities in South Bronx predisposed this community to a large number of infectious cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of exposure to the infection. This study aims to assess seroprevalence and the associated characteristics of consenting HCWs from an NYC public hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes serum samples for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; PCR and completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. Participants' risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in the hospital and in the community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas was also considered an additional risk. The Odds Ratio with bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated with seroprevalence. Results: A total of 500 HCW were tested, 137 (27%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Symptomatic participants had a 75% rate of seroconversion compared to those without symptoms. Subjects with anosmia and ageusia had increased odds of seroconversion in comparison to those without these symptoms. Community exposure was 34% among those who had positive antibodies. Conclusion: Seroprevalence among HCWs was high compared to the community at the epicenter of the pandemic. Further studies to evaluate sustained adaptive immunity in this high-risk group will guide our response to a future surge."
24,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR positivity in COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors.,"Background: Nucleic acid persists after symptom resolution and infectivity for many viral infections via delayed clearance of nucleic acid fragments, non-infectious particles, or transmissible virus. For Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the relationship between nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positivity, the development of antibodies against COVID-19, and clinical history are unclear. Study design and methods: Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and volunteered to donate convalescent plasma (CP) were screened by NP swab PCR, responded to a questionnaire, and were tested for anti-COVID-19 antibodies. Results: A proportion of 11.8% of individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NP swab PCR greater than 14 days after the resolution of symptoms of active disease, including one donor who had asymptomatic disease and tested positive by NP swab 41 days after her initial diagnosis. Clinical history did not show a significant correlation with persistence of NP swab positivity. Also, NP swab positivity >14 days from symptom resolution did not correlate with anti-COVID-19 serology results. IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody strength correlated with hospitalization for COVID-19 using two different assays. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody strength correlated with time from symptom resolution to sample collection and symptom duration. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is detectable long after the resolution of symptoms in a significant percentage of previously diagnosed individuals, which is important to consider when interpreting PCR swab results. Persistence of PCR positivity does not correlate with antibody strength or symptoms of COVID-19. If anti-spike antibody is used to assess CP potency, individuals who suffered severe COVID-19 disease symptoms may represent better donors."
25,Paper-based electrochemical biosensor for diagnosing COVID-19: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and antigen.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is emerging as a global pandemic outbreak. To date, approximately one million deaths and over 32 million cases have been reported. This ongoing pandemic urgently requires an accurate testing device that can be used in the field in a fast manner. Serological assays to detect antibodies have been proven to be a great complement to the standard method of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), particularly after the second week of infection. We have developed a specific and sensitive immunosensor for immunoglobulin detection produced against SARS-CoV-2. Unlike other lateral flow-based assays (LFAs) involving the utilization of multiple antibodies, we have reported a label-free paper-based electrochemical platform targeting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies without the specific requirement of an antibody. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will interrupt the redox conversion of the redox indicator, resulting in a decreased current response. This electrochemical sensor was proven effective in real clinical sera from patients with satisfactory results. In addition, the proposed format was also extended to antigen detection (the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2), which presents new possibilities for diagnosing COVID-19."
26,Effectiveness of Adding a Mask Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Danish Mask Wearers : A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Background: Observational evidence suggests that mask wearing mitigates transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is uncertain if this observed association arises through protection of uninfected wearers (protective effect), via reduced transmission from infected mask wearers (source control), or both. Objective: To assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the home reduces wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where masks were uncommon and not among recommended public health measures. Design: Randomized controlled trial (DANMASK-19 [Danish Study to Assess Face Masks for the Protection Against COVID-19 Infection]). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04337541). Setting: Denmark, April and May 2020. Participants: Adults spending more than 3 hours per day outside the home without occupational mask use. Intervention: Encouragement to follow social distancing measures for coronavirus disease 2019, plus either no mask recommendation or a recommendation to wear a mask when outside the home among other persons together with a supply of 50 surgical masks and instructions for proper use. Measurements: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mask wearer at 1 month by antibody testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or hospital diagnosis. The secondary outcome was PCR positivity for other respiratory viruses. Results: A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was -0.3 percentage point (95% CI, -1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection. Limitation: Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others. Conclusion: The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection. Primary funding source: The Salling Foundations."
27,Resolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in China in December, 2019, and declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. The current management of COVID-19 is based generally on supportive therapy and treatment to prevent respiratory failure. The effective option of antiviral therapy and vaccination are currently under evaluation and development. Areas covered: A literature search was performed using PubMed between December 1, 2019-June 23, 2020. This review highlights the current state of knowledge on the viral replication and pathogenicity, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and management of COVID-19. This review will be of interest to scientists and clinicians and make a significant contribution toward development of vaccines and targeted therapies to contain the pandemic. Expert opinion: The exit strategy for a path back to normal life is required, which should involve a multi-prong effort toward development of new treatment and a successful vaccine to protect public health worldwide and prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks. Therefore, the bench to bedside translational research as well as reverse translational works focusing bedside to bench is very important and would provide the foundation for the development of targeted drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 infections."
28,The potential application of electrochemical biosensors in the COVID-19 pandemic: A perspective on the rapid diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2.,"Electrochemical biosensors combine the selectivity of electrochemical signal transducers with the specificity of biomolecular recognition strategies. Although they have been broadly studied in different areas of diagnostics, they are not yet fully commercialized. During the COVID-19 pandemic, electrochemical platforms have shown the potential to address significant limitations of conventional diagnostic platforms, including accuracy, affordability, and portability. The advantages of electrochemical platforms make them a strong candidate for rapid point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection by targeting not only viral RNA but antigens and antibodies. Herein, we reviewed advancements in electrochemical biosensing platforms towards the detection of SARS-CoV-2 through studying similar viruses."
29,Development of a SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody Assay and the Dynamics of Antibody Response over Time in Hospitalized and Nonhospitalized Patients with COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infections often cause only mild disease that may evoke relatively low Ab titers compared with patients admitted to hospitals. Generally, total Ab bridging assays combine good sensitivity with high specificity. Therefore, we developed sensitive total Ab bridging assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 Abs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein in addition to conventional isotype-specific assays. Ab kinetics was assessed in PCR-confirmed, hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (n = 41) and three populations of patients with COVID-19 symptoms not requiring hospital admission: PCR-confirmed convalescent plasmapheresis donors (n = 182), PCR-confirmed hospital care workers (n = 47), and a group of longitudinally sampled symptomatic individuals highly suspect of COVID-19 (n = 14). In nonhospitalized patients, the Ab response to RBD is weaker but follows similar kinetics, as has been observed in hospitalized patients. Across populations, the RBD bridging assay identified most patients correctly as seropositive. In 11/14 of the COVID-19-suspect cases, seroconversion in the RBD bridging assay could be demonstrated before day 12; nucleocapsid protein Abs emerged less consistently. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of finger-prick sampling for Ab detection against SARS-CoV-2 using these assays. In conclusion, the developed bridging assays reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 Abs in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients and are therefore well suited to conduct seroprevalence studies."
30,Differences of SARS-CoV-2 serological test performance between hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases.,"Background: Serological severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody assays differ in the target antigen specificity, e.g. of antibodies directed against the viral spike or the nucleocapsid protein, and in the spectrum of detected immunoglobulins. The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of two different routinely used immunoassays in hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases. Methods: The test characteristics of commercially available spike1 protein-based serological assays (Euroimmun, EI-assays), determining IgA or IgG and nucleocapsid-based assays (Virotech, VT-assays) determining IgA, IgM or IgG were compared in 139 controls and 116 hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases. Results: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 51; 115 samples) showed significantly higher concentrations of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and differed from outpatient cases (n = 65) by higher age, higher disease severity scores and earlier follow up blood sampling. Sensitivity of the two IgG assays was comparable in hospitalized patients tested ≥ 14 days (EI-assay: 88%, CI95% 67.6-99.9; VT-assay: 96%, CI95% 77.7-99.8). In outpatient COVID-19 cases sensitivity was significantly lower in the VT-assay (86.2%, CI95% 74.8-93.1) compared with the EI-assay (98.5%, CI95% 90.6-99.9). Assays for IgA and IgM demonstrated a lack of specificity or sensitivity. Conclusions: Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 serological assays may need to be optimized to produce reliable results in outpatient COVID-19 cases who are low or even asymptomatic. Assays for IgA and IgM have limited diagnostic performance and do not prove an additional value for population-based screening approaches."
31,Comparison of Rapid Antigen Tests for COVID-19.,"Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)-based tests are widely used to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As a result that these tests cannot be done in local clinics where RT-qPCR testing capability is lacking, rapid antigen tests (RATs) for COVID-19 based on lateral flow immunoassays are used for rapid diagnosis. However, their sensitivity compared with each other and with RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation has not been examined. Here, we compared the sensitivity among four RATs by using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates and several types of COVID-19 patient specimens and compared their sensitivity with that of RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation. Although the RATs read the samples containing large amounts of virus as positive, even the most sensitive RAT read the samples containing small amounts of virus as negative. Moreover, all RATs tested failed to detect viral antigens in several specimens from which the virus was isolated. The current RATs will likely miss some COVID-19 patients who are shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2."
32,CRISPR-based biosensing systems: a way to rapidly diagnose COVID-19.,"The outbreak of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus has highlighted the challenges of detecting viral infections, especially in resource-limited settings. The SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission chain is interrupted when screening and diagnosis can be performed on a large scale by identifying asymptomatic or moderately symptomatic patients. Diagnosis of COVID-19 with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been limited due to inadequate access to complex, expensive equipment and reagents, which has impeded efforts to reduce the spread of virus transmission. Recently, the development of several diagnostic platforms based on the CRISPR-Cas system has reduced the dependence on RT-PCR. The first CRISPR-based diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The biosensing systems have several important features that make them suitable for point-of-care tests, including the speed of design and synthesis of each platform in less than a few days, an assay time of 1-2 h, and the cost of materials and reagents less than one dollar per test. The HUDSON-SHERLOCK and STOPCovid biosensing systems, as field-deployable and rapid diagnostic tests, can detect low-copy viruses in body fluids without nucleic acid extraction and with minimal equipment. In addition, Cas13-based treatment strategies could potentially be an effective antiviral strategy for the prevention and treatment of emerging pandemic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we describe recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnostic platforms with an emphasis on their use in the rapid diagnosis and potential treatment of COVID-19."
33,Asymptomatic COVID-19 with ambiguous test results.,"Background: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is a significant part of the effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Mass testing of healthy individuals raises several issues, however, and the results can be challenging to interpret. Case presentation: A healthy 19-year-old man entered the military after two weeks of quarantine. The recruit had no respiratory symptoms or fever before, during or after his enrolment, and no history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. At enrolment, he had a positive rapid test and a venous blood sample showed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. PCR tests of specimens obtained from the upper respiratory tract were negative at enrolment and at week three, but were positive at week six. Interpretation: The overall assessment of all the tests indicates a probable asymptomatic infection. This case report illustrates the challenge of interpreting screening results in asymptomatic individuals."
34,Rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection assay in comparison with real-time RT-PCR assay for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 in Thailand.,"Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread across the world. Hence, there is an urgent need for rapid, simple, and accurate tests to diagnose severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Performance characteristics of the rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test should be evaluated and compared with the gold standard real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for diagnosis of COVID-19 cases. Methods: The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test, Standard™ Q COVID-19 Ag kit (SD Biosensor®, Republic of Korea), was compared with the real-time RT-PCR test, Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene®, Korea) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens. Four hundred fifty-four respiratory samples (mainly nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) were obtained from COVID-19 suspected cases and contact individuals, including pre-operative patients at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during March-May 2020. Results: Of 454 respiratory samples, 60 (13.2%) were positive, and 394 (86.8%) were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time RT-PCR assay. The duration from onset to laboratory test in COVID-19 suspected cases and contact individuals ranged from 0 to 14 days with a median of 3 days. The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test's sensitivity and specificity were 98.33% (95% CI, 91.06-99.96%) and 98.73% (95% CI, 97.06-99.59%), respectively. One false negative test result was from a sample with a high real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct), while five false positive test results were from specimens of pre-operative patients. Conclusions: The rapid assay for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection showed comparable sensitivity and specificity with the real-time RT-PCR assay. Thus, there is a potential use of this rapid and simple SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test as a screening assay."
35,Current Status of Diagnostic Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Future Developments: A Review.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 50.6 million individuals and caused over 1.2 million deaths globally, raising a major health concern. To date, no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are therefore critical for controlling the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and optimizing clinical care, infection control, and public health interventions. The FDA has issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for hundreds of COVID-19 diagnostic tests of different classes. Whereas nucleic acid testing (NAT) such as RT-PCR remains the criterion standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, serological antibody and antigen tests are increasingly being developed. Tests based on the novel RNA sensing techniques (e.g., SHERLOCK, DETECTR, and Toehold Switch) are promising due to their relatively low cost, high accuracy, and rapid detection time. Diagnostic testing results for SARS-CoV-2 should be interpreted with caution, since they depend heavily on factors such as viral load, virus replication, the source and timing of sample collection, sample extraction, and characteristics of various testing methods. This review aims to present the current status of common diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, review the current regulatory requirements, and identify future directions in the development of improved diagnostics that are more accurate, accessible, and rapid."
36,Dynamics of Blood Viral Load Is Strongly Associated with Clinical Outcomes in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"The prevalence and clinical relevance of viremia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been well studied. A prospective cohort study was designed to investigate blood viral load and clearance kinetics in 52 patients (median age, 62 years; 31 [59.6%] male) and explore their association with clinical features and outcomes based on a novel one-step RT droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR). By using one-step RT-ddPCR, 92.3% (48 of 52) of this cohort was quantitatively detected with viremia. The concordance between the blood and oropharyngeal swab tests was 60.92% (53 of 87). One-step RT-ddPCR was tested with a 3.03% false-positive rate and lower 50% confidence interval of detection at 54.026 copies/mL plasma. There was no reduction in the blood viral load in all critical patients, whereas the general and severe patients exhibited a similar ability to clear the viral load. The viral loads in critical patients were significantly higher than those in their general and severe counterparts. Among the 52 study patients, 30 (58%) were discharged from the hospital. Among half of the 30 discharged patients, blood viral load remained positive, of which 76.9% (10 of 13) completely cleared their blood viral load at follow-up. Meanwhile, none of their close contacts had evidence of infection. Quantitative determination of the blood viral test is of great clinical significance in the management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019."
37,Evaluation of serum IgM and IgG antibodies in COVID-19 patients by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sweeping the world since the end of 2019. The titer change of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further clarified, the clinical and preventive value of antibodies still needs to be further investigated. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established by coating with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein and used to detect serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in coronavirus disease 2019 patients to evaluate the pattern of changes of antibodies. The specificity of the ELISA for detection SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were 96% (144/150) and 100% (150/150), respectively. The sensitivity of ELISA was 100% (150/150) for IgM, and 99.3% (149/150) for IgG. SARS-CoV-2-SP-IgM and SP-IgG antibodies could be detected on Day 1 of hospitalization in 12.5% patients, and SP-IgM began to decrease after reaching its peak at around 22-28 days, and become negative at Month 3 in 30% patients and negative at Month 7 in 79% of these patients after onset; IgG reached its peak around Day 22-28 and kept at a high level within the longest observation period for 4 months, it dropped very sharply at 7 months. The positive rates of SP-IgM and SP-IgG were higher than those of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on Day 7 and 4. The established indirect ELISA has good specificity and sensitivity. IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 appeared almost simultaneously in the early stage, and the level of IgG antibodies could not maintain a high plateau in the observation period of 7 months. Our data will help develop the diagnosis and vaccine of SARS-CoV-2."
38,Summary of the Detection Kits for SARS-CoV-2 Approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China and Their Application for Diagnosis of COVID-19.,"The on-going global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been underway for about 11 months. Through November 20, 2020, 51 detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids (24 kits), antibodies (25 kits), or antigens (2 kits) have been approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China (NMPA). Convenient and reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection assays are urgently needed worldwide for strategic control of the pandemic. In this review, the detection kits approved in China are summarised and the three types of tests, namely nucleic acid, serological and antigen detection, which are available for the detection of COVID-19 are discussed in detail. The development of novel detection kits will lay the foundation for the control and prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic globally."
39,Negative results in nucleic acid test of COVID-19 patients: assessment from the perspective of clinical laboratories.,"Since December 2019, there had been an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is prevalent around the world, and the number of infected cases has increased rapidly. Viral nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 can provide direct evidence for rapid diagnosis, disease course monitoring, and therapeutic efficacy. However, in practice, false-negative results in nucleic acid test are common, causing missed diagnoses, which are not conducive to the prevention and control of this outbreak. This article analyzes the possible causes and proposed measures to reduce the false-negative rate of nucleic acid test results and more effectively curb the outbreak."
40,Genetics and genomics of SARS-CoV-2: A review of the literature with the special focus on genetic diversity and SARS-CoV-2 genome detection.,"The outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, started in late 2019; in a short time, it has spread rapidly all over the world. Although some possible antiviral and anti-inflammatory medications are available, thousands of people are dying daily. Well-understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is not only essential for the development of new treatments/vaccines, but it also can be used for improving the sensitivity and specificity of current approaches for virus detection. Accordingly, we reviewed the most critical findings related to the genetics of the SARS-CoV-2, with a specific focus on genetic diversity and reported mutations, molecular-based diagnosis assays, using interfering RNA technology for the treatment of patients, and genetic-related vaccination strategies. Additionally, considering the unanswered questions or uncertainties in these regards, different topics were discussed."
41,Development and evaluation of a serological test for diagnosis of COVID-19 with selected recombinant spike proteins.,"Serological test is a valuable diagnostic tool for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, considerable improvements to these tests are needed, especially in the detection sensitivity. In this study, six recombinant nucleocapsid and spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were prepared and evaluated, including three prokaryotic expression nucleocapsid proteins (rN, rN1, rN2) and three eukaryotic expression spike proteins (rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc). The recombinant proteins with the highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) were selected to develop a double-antigen sandwich colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) to detect total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The clinical evaluation results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of GICA were 92.09% (419/455) and 99.44% (706/710), respectively. Moreover, a significant number (65.63%, 21/32) of COVID-19 patients with undetectable viral RNA were correctly diagnosed by the GICA method. In conclusion, the eukaryotic expression spike proteins (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) are more suitable than the prokaryotic expression nucleocapsid proteins for serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed GICA for detection of total antibodies could be a powerful complement to the current RNA tests for COVID-19."
42,Diagnostic strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection and interpretation of microbiological results.,"Background: To face the current COVID-19 pandemic, diagnostic tools are essential. It is recommended to use real-time RT-PCR for RNA viruses in order (a) to perform a rapid and accurate diagnostic, (b) to guide patient care and management and (c) to guide epidemiological strategies. Further studies are warranted to define the role of serological diagnosis and a possible correlation between serological response and prognosis. Objectives: The aim was to guide clinical microbiologists in the use of these diagnostic tests and clinicians in the interpretation of their results. Sources: A search of literature was performed through PubMed and Google Scholar using the keywords SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 immune response, SARS-CoV-2 serology/antibody testing, coronavirus diagnosis. Content: The present review discusses performances, limitations and use of current and future diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2. Implications: Real-time RT-PCR remains the reference method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, notwithstanding its varying sensitivity according to the time of infection, serology represents a valid asset (a) to try to solve possible discrepancies between a highly suggestive clinical and radiological presentation and negative RT-PCR, (b) to solve discrepancies between different PCR assays and (c) for epidemiological purposes."
43,Recommendations for use of antigenic tests in the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the second pandemic wave: attitude in different clinical settings.,"The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 before and shortly after the onset of symptoms suggests that only diagnosing and isolating symptomatic patients may not be sufficient to interrupt the spread of infection; therefore, public health measures such as personal distancing are also necessary. Additionally, it will be important to detect the newly infected individuals who remain asymptomatic, which may account for 50% or more of the cases. Molecular techniques are the ""gold standard"" for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the massive use of these techniques has generated some problems. On the one hand, the scarcity of resources (analyzers, fungibles and reagents), and on the other the delay in the notification of results. These two facts translate into a lag in the application of isolation measures among cases and contacts, which favors the spread of the infection. Antigen detection tests are also direct diagnostic methods, with the advantage of obtaining the result in a few minutes and at the very ""pointof-care"". Furthermore, the simplicity and low cost of these tests allow them to be repeated on successive days in certain clinical settings. The sensitivity of antigen tests is generally lower than that of nucleic acid tests, although their specificity is comparable. Antigenic tests have been shown to be more valid in the days around the onset of symptoms, when the viral load in the nasopharynx is higher. Having a rapid and real-time viral detection assay such as the antigen test has been shown to be more useful to control the spread of the infection than more sensitive tests, but with greater cost and response time, such as in case of molecular tests. The main health institutions such as the WHO, the CDC and the Ministry of Health of the Government of Spain propose the use of antigenic tests in a wide variety of strategies to respond to the pandemic. This document aims to support physicians involved in the care of patients with suspected SC2 infection, in the context of a growing incidence in Spain since September 2020, which already represents the second pandemic wave of COVID-19."
44,A Convalescent of COVID-19 with RT-PCR Test Continues Positive in Stool.,"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected more than 100 countries worldwide and the discharge criteria of patients with COVID-19 vary across different countries. In China, patients with two negative respiratory viral RNA tests taken at least one day apart can be discharged with no further quarantine required. Currently, PCR testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in fecal sample is not routinely performed. Methods: We present a patient with COVID-19, whose respiratory swabs became negative but fecal sample remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results: Stool sample collected on 27th of February was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 24 days after the first negative respiratory swab. Conclusions: Based on the experience from the 2003 SARS epidemic, we recommend that fecal RNA testing of SARS-CoV-2 should be incorporated into the discharge criteria to minimize the risk of transmission from the gastrointestinal tract."
45,Point-of-Care PCR Assays for COVID-19 Detection.,"Molecular diagnostics has been the front runner in the world's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the quantitative variant (qRT-PCR) have been the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, faster antigen tests and other point-of-care (POC) devices have also played a significant role in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by facilitating mass screening and delivering results in less time. Thus, despite the higher sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR assays, the impact of POC tests cannot be ignored. As a consequence, there has been an increased interest in the development of miniaturized, high-throughput, and automated PCR systems, many of which can be used at point-of-care. This review summarizes the recent advances in the development of miniaturized PCR systems with an emphasis on COVID-19 detection. The distinct features of digital PCR and electrochemical PCR are detailed along with the challenges. The potential of CRISPR/Cas technology for POC diagnostics is also highlighted. Commercial RT-PCR POC systems approved by various agencies for COVID-19 detection are discussed."
46,opvCRISPR: One-pot visual RT-LAMP-CRISPR platform for SARS-cov-2 detection.,"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected all aspects of human life. Rapid, accurate, sensitive and user friendly detection method is urgently needed to facilitate early intervention and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we propose a one-pot visual SARS-CoV-2 detection system named ""opvCRISPR"" by integrating reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and Cas12a cleavage in a single reaction system. We demonstrate that the collateral activity against single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) reporters of activated Cas12a triggered by RT-LAMP amplicon increases detection sensitivity and makes detection results observable with naked eye. The opvCRISPR enables detection at nearly single molecule level in 45 min. We validate this method with 50 SARS-CoV-2 potentially infected clinical samples. The opvCRISPR diagnostic results provide 100% agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-approved quantitative RT-PCR assay. The opvCRISPR holds great potential for SARS-CoV-2 detection in next-generation point-of-care molecular diagnostics."
47,Protein-based lateral flow assays for COVID-19 detection.,"To combat the enduring and dangerous spread of COVID-19, many innovations to rapid diagnostics have been developed based on proteinprotein interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins to increase testing accessibility. These antigen tests have most prominently been developed using the lateral flow assay (LFA) test platform which has the benefit of administration at point-of-care, delivering quick results, lower cost, and does not require skilled personnel. However, they have gained criticism for an inferior sensitivity. In the last year, much attention has been given to creating a rapid LFA test for detection of COVID-19 antigens that can address its high limit of detection while retaining the advantages of rapid antibodyantigen interaction. In this review, a summary of these proteinprotein interactions as well as the challenges, benefits, and recent improvements to protein based LFA for detection of COVID-19 are discussed."
48,COVID-19 Threat to the World: Current and Possible Diagnostic/Treatment Strategies.,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a world-wide crisis. To contain the virus, it is important to find infected individuals and isolate them to stop transmission. Various diagnostic techniques are used to check for infection. With the havoc that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created, it is imperative to work on alternative diagnostic techniques that can be used at both point of care with little or no expertise and at mass testing (i.e., when screening). Despite extensive research, to this date no specific effective treatment or cure is available to neutralize this viral infection. Globally, researchers are working to develop effective treatments, and several vaccines have been approved for public use. We found the studies that we explored for this review using appropriate key words for indexing in PubMed and Google Scholar from 2019 to 2020. We compile various techniques that have been used worldwide to diagnose and treat SARS-CoV-2 and discuss novel methods that may be modified for use in diagnosis and treatment. It is crucial to develop a more specific serological test for diagnosis that can rule out the possibility of COVID-19 and be used for mass testing. An affordable, safe, targeted, effective treatment must be developed to cure this disease, which has created a public health emergency of international concern."
49,Novel approaches for rapid detection of COVID-19 during the pandemic: A review.,"The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused the COVID-19 disease, has highlighted our urgent need for sensitive, fast and accurate diagnostic technologies. In fact, one of the main challenges for flatting COVID-19 spread charts is the ability to accurately and rapidly identify asymptomatic cases that result in spreading the virus to close contacts. SARS-CoV-2 virus mutation is also relatively rapid, which makes the detection of COVID-19 diseases still crucial even after the vaccination. Conventional techniques, which are commercially available have focused on clinical manifestation, along with molecular and serological detection tools that can identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus however, owing to various disadvantages including low specificity and sensitivity, a quick, low cost and easy approach is needed for diagnosis of COVID-19. Scientists are now showing extensive interest in an effective portable and simple detection method to diagnose COVID-19. There are several novel methods and approaches that are considered viable advanced systems that can meet the demands. This study reviews the new approaches and sensing technologies that work on COVID-19 diagnosis for easy and successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus."
50,"COVID-19 pandemic: from origins to outcomes. A comprehensive review of viral pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic evaluation, and management.","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen for the COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and by March 2020, it was declared a pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic has overburdened healthcare systems in most countries and has led to massive economic losses. SARS-CoV-2 transmission typically occurs by respiratory droplets. The average incubation period is 6.4 days and presenting symptoms typically include fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia or fatigue. While the majority of patients tend to have a mild illness, a minority of patients develop severe hypoxia requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Management is mostly supportive. However, several direct anti-viral agents, and immunomodulatory therapy with steroids and various cytokine blockers seem promising in early results. However, an effective vaccine has been established, which will help curb the pandemic."
51,Analytical sensitivity and clinical sensitivity of the three rapid antigen detection kits for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus.,"Background: Numerous rapid antigen detection (RAD) kits for diagnosing COVID-19 patients are available in the market recently. Objective: To compare analytical sensitivity and clinical sensitivity for the three commercially available RAD kits. Study design: Analytical sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus was determined by limit of detection (LOD) using RT-PCR as a reference method. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using respiratory specimens collected from confirmed COVID-19 patients. Results: The LOD results showed that the three RAD kits varied from 102-105 fold less sensitive than RT-PCR. Clinical sensitivity of RAD kits ranged from 22.9 %-71.4 % for detecting specimens from COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Although RAD kits were less sensitive than RT-PCR, understanding the clinical characteristics of different RAD kits can guide us to obtain suitable specimens for testing. The likelihood of positive results for RAD kits will be higher."
52,"Postvaccination COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers, Israel.","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms can be mistaken for vaccine-related side effects during initial days after immunization. Among 4,081 vaccinated healthcare workers in Israel, 22 (0.54%) developed COVID-19 from 1-10 days (median 3.5 days) after immunization. Clinicians should not dismiss postvaccination symptoms as vaccine-related and should promptly test for COVID-19."
53,"Emerging point-of-care biosensors for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19: current progress, challenges, and future prospects.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently a serious global health threat. While conventional laboratory tests such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), serology tests, and chest computerized tomography (CT) scan allow diagnosis of COVID-19, these tests are time-consuming and laborious, and are limited in resource-limited settings or developing countries. Point-of-care (POC) biosensors such as chip-based and paper-based biosensors are typically rapid, portable, cost-effective, and user-friendly, which can be used for COVID-19 in remote settings. The escalating demand for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 presents a strong need for a timely and comprehensive review on the POC biosensors for COVID-19 that meet ASSURED criteria: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and Robust, Equipment-free, and Deliverable to end users. In the present review, we discuss the importance of rapid and early diagnosis of COVID-19 and pathogenesis of COVID-19 along with the key diagnostic biomarkers. We critically review the most recent advances in POC biosensors which show great promise for the detection of COVID-19 based on three main categories: chip-based biosensors, paper-based biosensors, and other biosensors. We subsequently discuss the key benefits of these biosensors and their use for the detection of antigen, antibody, and viral nucleic acids. The commercial POC biosensors for COVID-19 are critically compared. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and future perspectives of developing emerging POC biosensors for COVID-19. This review would be very useful for guiding strategies for developing and commercializing rapid POC tests to manage the spread of infections.Graphical abstract."
54,The role of close contacts of COVID-19 patients in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission: an emphasis on the percentage of nonevaluated positivity in Mexico.,"Objectives: To determine the percentage of positivity of close contacts of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients to depict the importance of asymptomatic infections in the patient-to-patient transmission of COVID-19. Methods: One hundred subjects were included. Nineteen index COVID-19 cases and 81 traced close contacts were screened for coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunoglobulin M and G against SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by rapid test. Results: Thirty-four (42%) contacts in the study were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-three (67.6%) manifested less than 2 respiratory symptoms, and 5 (14.7%) remained asymptomatic. The average of positive contacts by index COVID-19 case (R0) was 4.3 and the mean of time of positive COVID-19 test at sampling time was 18.9 days. Positive antibody test against SARS-CoV-2 was observed in 16% of the participants. Conclusion: The proportion of close contacts of COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (42%) and with less than 2 or with no respiratory symptoms (82.4%) was high in the study population. A low proportion of COVID-19 patients had a positive test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The screening for SARS-CoV-2 in close contacts of COVID-19 positive patients should be encouraged to avoid spreading the infection and the expansion of the disease."
55,"COVID-19: A Review on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Evolution, Transmission, Detection, Control and Prevention.","Three major outbreaks of the coronavirus, a zoonotic virus known to cause respiratory disease, have been reported since 2002, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the most recent 2019-nCoV, or more recently known as SARS-CoV-2. Bats are known to be the primary animal reservoir for coronaviruses. However, in the past few decades, the virus has been able to mutate and adapt to infect humans, resulting in an animal-to-human species barrier jump. The emergence of a novel coronavirus poses a serious global public health threat and possibly carries the potential of causing a major pandemic outbreak in the naïve human population. The recent outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has infected over 36.5 million individuals and claimed over one million lives worldwide, as of 8 October 2020. The novel virus is rapidly spreading across China and has been transmitted to 213 other countries/territories across the globe. Researchers have reported that the virus is constantly evolving and spreading through asymptomatic carriers, further suggesting a high global health threat. To this end, current up-to-date information on the coronavirus evolution and SARS-CoV-2 modes of transmission, detection techniques and current control and prevention strategies are summarized in this review."
56,How Useful is COVID-19 Antibody Testing - A Current Assessment for Oncologists.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to infection by a new human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has seriously disrupted the provision of oncology services and their uptake. Antibody testing, both at an individual level and of populations, has been widely viewed to be a key activity for guiding the options for treatment of high-risk individuals, as well as the implementation of safe control of infection measures. Ideally, the detection of a specific antibody should signify that all individuals tested have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and that in the case of specific IgG that they are immune to further infection. This would enable SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to be appropriately managed and healthcare workers shown to be immune to return to work where they would no longer pose a risk to their patients or be at risk themselves. Unfortunately, this is not the case for COVID-19, where it has been shown that immunity may not be protective, and seroconversion delayed or absent. The variability in antibody test performance, particularly that of lateral flow assays, has caused confusion for the public and healthcare professions alike. Many antibody test devices have been made available without independent evaluations and these may lack both adequate sensitivity and specificity. This review seeks to educate healthcare workers, particularly those working in oncology, of the current benefits and limitations of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing."
57,Infectivity of deceased COVID-19 patients.,"The duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in living patients has been demarcated. In contrast, a possible SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of corpses and subsequently its duration under post mortem circumstances remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the infectivity and its duration of deceased COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) patients. Four SARS-CoV-2 infected deceased patients were subjected to medicolegal autopsy. Post mortem intervals (PMI) of 1, 4, 9 and 17 days, respectively, were documented. During autopsy, swabs and organ samples were taken and examined by RT-qPCR (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA). Determination of infectivity was performed by means of virus isolation in cell culture. In two cases, virus isolation was successful for swabs and tissue samples of the respiratory tract (PMI 4 and 17 days). The two infectious cases showed a shorter duration of COVID-19 until death than the two non-infectious cases (2 and 11 days, respectively, compared to > 19 days), which correlates with studies of living patients, in which infectivity could be narrowed to about 6 days before to 12 days after symptom onset. Most notably, infectivity was still present in one of the COVID-19 corpses after a post-mortem interval of 17 days and despite already visible signs of decomposition. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in all professional groups involved in the handling and examination of COVID-19 corpses, adequate personal safety standards (reducing or avoiding aerosol formation and wearing FFP3 [filtering face piece class 3] masks) have to be enforced for routine procedures."
58,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Diagnostic Tools: A Focus on Detection Technologies and Limitations.,"The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a severe threat to human health and the global economy and has resulted in overwhelming stress on health care systems worldwide. Despite the global health catastrophe, especially in the number of infections and fatalities, the COVID-19 pandemic has also revolutionized research and discovery with remarkable success in diagnostics, treatments, and vaccine development. The use of many diagnostic methods has helped establish public health guidelines to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. However, limited information has been shared about these methods, and there is a need for the scientific community to learn about these technologies, in addition to their sensitivity, specificity, and limitations. This review article is focused on providing insights into the major methods used for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We describe in detail the core principle of each method, including molecular and serological approaches, along with reported claims about the rates of false negatives and false positives, the types of specimens needed, and the level of technology and the time required to perform each test. Although this study will not rank or prioritize these methods, the information will help in the development of guidelines and diagnostic protocols in clinical settings and reference laboratories."
59,Road toward universal COVID-19 testing method - A review.,"Patients infected with novel coronavirus exhibit a wide range of symptoms from common cold to pneumonia. Furthermore, several cases have been reported as asymptomatic across the globe. Since there are no conclusive clinical manifestations, clinicians have to rely more on laboratory diagnostic methods for confirmation of coronavirus disease. Hematological and biochemical tests are found to be of more prognostic value. Genetic assays by means of rRT-PCR technique is time-consuming but seems to be a more sensitive and specific test among the available testing methods for diagnosis of the coronavirus disease. Radiological imaging of the CT chest of the confirmed positive patients taken during the initial few days doesn't show any significant changes. However, from the second week onward a ground glass lesion pattern is observed. The immunological tests which are being used as a rapid testing method are found to be more false test negative. Hence, based on the effectiveness of various testing methods, it can be concluded that either rRT-PCR or mass antibody testing has to be done, and it has to be compared with CT chest in order to avoid false negatives across the globe which may help in the prevention of community spread of the disease."
60,A review on current diagnostic techniques for COVID-19.,"Introduction: SARS-Cov-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and spread all over the world soon after that. Given the infectious nature ofSARS-CoV-2, fast and accurate diagnosis tools are important to detect the virus. In this review, we discuss the different diagnostic tests that are currently being implemented in laboratories and provide a description of various COVID-19 kits. Areas covered: We summarize molecular techniques that target the viral load, serological methods used for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies detection as well as newly developed faster assays for the detection of SARS-COV 2 in various biological samples. Expert opinion: In the light of the widespread pandemic, the massive diagnosis of COVID-19, using various detection techniques, appears to be the most effective strategy for monitoring and containing its propagation."
61,The diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 pneumonia: A review of laboratory and radiological testing results.,"The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has necessitated the implementation of diverse pandemic control strategies throughout the world. To effectively control the spread of this disease, it is essential that it be diagnosed at an early stage so that patients can be reliably quarantined such that disease spread will be slowed. At present, the diagnosis of this infectious form of coronavirus pneumonia is largely dependent upon a combination of laboratory testing and imaging analyses of variable diagnostic efficacy. In the present report, we reviewed prior literature pertaining to the diagnosis of different forms of pneumonia caused by coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, and SARS-CoV-2) and assessed two different potential diagnostic approaches. We ultimately found that computed tomography was associated with a higher rate of diagnostic accuracy than was a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based approach (P = .0041), and chest radiography (P = .0100). Even so, it is important that clinicians utilize a combination of laboratory and radiological testing where possible to ensure that this virus is reliably and quickly detected such that it may be treated and patients may be isolated in a timely fashion, thereby effectively curbing the further progression of this pandemic."
62,Current scenario of COVID-19 vaccinations and immune response along with antibody titer in vaccinated inhabitants of different countries.,"The COVID-19 pandemic challenges have been only partially addressed so far. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is considered the combination of severe and high infectivity. Herdimmunity is attained when a critical proportion of the population is immune, providing the virus with fewer chances to spread locally. To overcome the rising tide of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficacious and safe vaccines providing defensive and long-lasting immunity responses are urgently needed.Vaccines that induce virus-neutralizing antibodies with great affinity can optimally fight against infection. Worldwide, over 120 novel vaccine candidates, including live-attenuated, inactivated, viral-vectored nonreplicating and replicating, peptide- and protein-based, and nucleic acid-based approaches are in the process of preclinical and clinical trials (phase 1-4). In addition to comprehensive safety assessments and immune responses, precise clinical management is also important for trials of vaccines. The recent emergence of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 is becoming a new threat for the world and a challenge for scientists to introduce the most influential vaccine against COVID-19. The possibility of natural and vaccine-induced immunity in variants finds it necessary to establish next-generation vaccines, which generate general neutralization against existing and future variants. Here, we summarize the cellular and humoral responses of SARS-CoV-2, current progress in vaccination development, the antibody titer response of available phase 4 vaccinations in vaccinated populations of different countries worldwide, and the success and challenges ahead of vaccine development."
63,Rapid identification of a human antibody with high prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in three animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Effective therapies are urgently needed for the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. We identified panels of fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from large phage-displayed Fab, scFv, and VH libraries by panning against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. A high-affinity Fab was selected from one of the libraries and converted to a full-size antibody, IgG1 ab1, which competed with human ACE2 for binding to RBD. It potently neutralized replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV, as measured by two different tissue culture assays, as well as a replication-competent mouse ACE2-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice and native virus in hACE2-expressing transgenic mice showing activity at the lowest tested dose of 2 mg/kg. IgG1 ab1 also exhibited high prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanism of neutralization is by competition with ACE2 but could involve antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as IgG1 ab1 had ADCC activity in vitro. The ab1 sequence has a relatively low number of somatic mutations, indicating that ab1-like antibodies could be quickly elicited during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or by RBD-based vaccines. IgG1 ab1 did not aggregate, did not exhibit other developability liabilities, and did not bind to any of the 5,300 human membrane-associated proteins tested. These results suggest that IgG1 ab1 has potential for therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The rapid identification (within 6 d of availability of antigen for panning) of potent mAbs shows the value of large antibody libraries for response to public health threats from emerging microbes."
64,"Simple, fast and affordable triaging pathway for COVID-19.","Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused a global pandemic. The majority of patients will experience mild disease, but others will develop a severe respiratory infection that requires hospitalisation. This is causing a significant strain on health services. Patients are presenting at emergency departments with symptoms of dyspnoea, dry cough and fever with varying severity. The appropriate triaging of patients will assist in preventing health services becoming overwhelmed during the pandemic. This is assisted through clinical assessment and various imaging and laboratory investigations, including chest X-ray, blood analysis and identification of viral infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here, a succinct triaging pathway that aims to be fast, reliable and affordable is presented. The hope is that such a pathway will assist health services in appropriately combating the pandemic."
65,Organ recovery from deceased donors with prior COVID-19: A case series.,"Although guidance documents have been published regarding organ donation from individuals with a prior history of COVID-19 infection, no data exist regarding successful recovery and transplantation from deceased donors with a history of or positive testing suggesting a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report a case series of six deceased donors with a history of COVID-19 from whom 13 organs were recovered and transplanted through several of the nation's organ procurement organizations (OPOs). In addition, at least two potential donors were authorized for donation but with no organs were successfully allocated and did not proceed to recovery. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reported from the six donors to recipients, procurement teams, or hospital personnel. Although more studies are needed, organ donation from deceased donors who have recovered from COVID-19 should be considered."
66,Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia despite missing detection of viral nucleic acid and initially inconspicuous radiologic findings.,"The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly based on a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. PCR samples are obtained from upper or lower respiratory tract specimens. However, the sensitivity of PCR is known to have some limitations. We report on a patient who was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea, fever, cough, and history of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected relative. The initial chest computed tomography (CT) showed only minimal changes and SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab sample was negative. PCR results obtained from further nasopharyngeal swabs, qualified sputum samples, and from a lower respiratory tract specimen also remained negative. At day 13 after admission, a second chest CT showed radiological findings suspicious for viral pneumonia. Finally, serologic results showed high levels of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A antibodies against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia."
67,Evaluation of droplet digital PCR for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 Virus in discharged COVID-19 patients.,"The worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has led to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, more and more infected patients are relapsing after discharge, which suggests qPCR may fail to detect the virus in some cases. In this study, we selected 74 clinical samples from 43 recovering inpatients for qPCR and Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) synchronous blind detection, and established a cutoff value for ddPCR diagnosis of COVID-19. The results showed that at a cutoff value of 0.04 copies/μL, the ddPCR sensitivity and specificity are 97.6% and 100%, respectively. In addition, we also analyzed 18 retained samples from 9 discharged patients who relapsed. Although qPCR showed all 18 samples to be negative, ddPCR showed 12 to be positive, and there was only one patient with two negative samples; the other eight patients had at least one positive sample. These results indicate that ddPCR could significantly improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis, especially for discharged patients with a low viral load, and help to reduce misdiagnosis during recovery."
68,Serological follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic subjects.,"SARS-CoV-2 symptoms are non-specific and can range from asymptomatic presentation to severe pneumonia. Asymptomatic subjects carrying SARS-CoV-2 often remain undiagnosed and it is still debated whether they develop immunoglobulins (Ig) and how long they persist. The aim of this study was to investigate the development and persistence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic subjects infected by the virus. This follow-up study was performed on the 31 asymptomatic subjects who presented a positive nasal swab or serology against SARS-CoV-2 (Ig against Spike-RBD) in the first part of the UNICORN study (March 2020) aimed at attesting previous or current contacts with the virus in the personnel of the University of Milan. Eight weeks after the first Ig measure, these subjects were invited to donate a second blood sample for testing serum antibodies (IgM, IgG and total antibodies) and to fill-in a structured questionnaire. About 80% of asymptomatic subjects did not present circulating immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks from a positive nasal swab against the virus. Moreover, in more than 40% of these subjects, no Ig against SARS-CoV-2 were detected at any time. Finally, about two third of subjects with immunoglobulins at baseline did not present IgG against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks. The majority of subjects who developed an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection do not present antibodies against the RBD-spike protein after 8 weeks of follow-up. These data should be taken into account for the interpretation of the serological evidences on SARS-CoV-2 that are emerging nowadays."
69,Recent advances in the diagnosis of COVID-19: a bird's eye view.,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is still escalating and has shaped an extraordinary and pressing need for rapid diagnostics with high sensitivity and specificity. Prompt diagnosis is the key to mitigate this situation. As several diagnostic tools for COVID-19 are already available and others are still under development, mandating a comprehensive review of the efficacy of existing tools and evaluate the potential of others. Areas covered: Currently explored platforms for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and surveillance centered on qRT-PCR, RT-PCR, CRISPR, microarray, LAMP, lateral flow immunoassays, proteomics-based approaches, and radiological scans are overviewed and summarized in this review along with their advantages and downsides. A narrative literature review was carried out by accessing the freely available online databases to encapsulate the developments in medical diagnostics. Expert opinion: An ideal detection method should be sensitive, specific, rapid, cost-effective, and should allow early diagnosis of the infection as near as possible to the point of care that could alter the current situation for the better. Medical diagnostics is a highly dynamic field as no diagnostic method available for SARS-CoV-2 detection offers a perfect solution and requires more attention and continuous R&D to challenge the present-day pandemic situation."
70,Fluorescence polarization system for rapid COVID-19 diagnosis.,"Prompt diagnosis, patient isolation, and contact tracing are key measures to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Molecular tests are the current gold standard for COVID-19 detection, but are carried out at central laboratories, delaying treatment and control decisions. Here we describe a portable assay system for rapid, onsite COVID-19 diagnosis. Termed CODA (CRISPR Optical Detection of Anisotropy), the method combined isothermal nucleic acid amplification, activation of CRISPR/Cas12a, and signal generation in a single assay, eliminating extra manual steps. Importantly, signal detection was based on the ratiometric measurement of fluorescent anisotropy, which allowed CODA to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio. For point-of-care operation, we built a compact, standalone CODA device integrating optoelectronics, an embedded heater, and a microcontroller for data processing. The developed system completed SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection within 20 min of sample loading; the limit of detection reached 3 copy/μL. When applied to clinical samples (10 confirmed COVID-19 patients; 10 controls), the rapid CODA test accurately classified COVID-19 status, in concordance with gold-standard clinical diagnostics."
71,Recent findings and applications of biomedical engineering for COVID-19 diagnosis: a critical review.,"COVID-19 is one of the most severe global health crises that humanity has ever faced. Researchers have restlessly focused on developing solutions for monitoring and tracing the viral culprit, SARS-CoV-2, as vital steps to break the chain of infection. Even though biomedical engineering (BME) is considered a rising field of medical sciences, it has demonstrated its pivotal role in nurturing the maturation of COVID-19 diagnostic technologies. Within a very short period of time, BME research applied to COVID-19 diagnosis has advanced with ever-increasing knowledge and inventions, especially in adapting available virus detection technologies into clinical practice and exploiting the power of interdisciplinary research to design novel diagnostic tools or improve the detection efficiency. To assist the development of BME in COVID-19 diagnosis, this review highlights the most recent diagnostic approaches and evaluates the potential of each research direction in the context of the pandemic."
72,SARS-CoV-2 Infection and the COVID-19 Pandemic Emergency: The Importance of Diagnostic Methods.,"Background: Currently, a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is underway, resulting in high morbidity and mortality across the globe. Summary: A prompt and effective diagnosis is crucial to identify infected individuals, to monitor the infection, to perform contact tracing, and to limit the spread of the virus. Since the announcement of this public health emergency, several diagnostic methods have been developed including molecular and serological assays, and more recently biosensors. Here, we present the use of these assays as well as their main technical features, advantages, and limits. Key Messages: The development of reliable diagnostic assays is crucial not only for a correct diagnosis and containment of COVID-19 pandemic, but also for the decision-making process that is behind the clinical decisions, eventually contributing to the improvement of patient management. Furthermore, with the advent of vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, serological assays will be instrumental for the validation of these new therapeutic options."
73,Infection and infectivity: Utility of rapid antigen tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19.,"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is commercially available in the form of lateral-flow rapid antigen test for the point-of-care diagnosis of COVID-19. This platform has been validated for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, for diagnosis or screening, and as part of single or sequential diagnostic strategies. Although in general less sensitive than amplification techniques, antigen tests may be particularly valid during the first days of symptoms and to detect individuals with greater viral load, thereby with enhanced chances of viral transmission. The simplicity of antigen tests make them very suitable to discard infection in settings with low pretest probability, and to detect infection in case of higher chances of having COVID-19."
74,[Application of the PCR number of cycle threshold value (Ct) in COVID-19].,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic persists with all its virulence despite 650,382,819 doses of COVID vaccine worldwide. The reference test for infection identification is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The usefulness of this test may be diminished by simplifying its result as positive or negative. Determining the number of cycles (Ct) in positive RT-qPCR tests can assist in decision-making when interpreted in the clinical context of patients."
75,"Post-vaccination cases of COVID-19 among healthcare workers at Siloam Teaching Hospital, Indonesia.","Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), compared with the general population. Therefore, they are given priority for the COVID-19 vaccine in the national COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Indonesia. However, while the daily number of new COVID-19 cases remains high, and data regarding the efficacy of the vaccine in healthcare settings remain unavailable, vaccinated HCWs remain at risk of COVID-19 infection and further transmission. Objective: To identify cases of COVID-19 among vaccinated HCWs at Siloam Teaching Hospital, Indonesia via active and passive surveillance conducted by the hospital's COVID-19 infection prevention and control unit. Results: Of 1040 HCWs who had received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, 13 (1.25%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction between 2 and 11 days (median 5 days) after the second vaccination. Conclusion: Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among vaccinated HCWs soon after the second vaccination indicates that HCWs remain at risk of COVID-19. Therefore, the presence of symptoms soon after full vaccination cannot be considered as vaccine-related symptoms, and regular COVID-19 testing should be conducted among HCWs."
76,Lessons learned 1 year after SARS-CoV-2 emergence leading to COVID-19 pandemic.,"Without modern medical management and vaccines, the severity of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might approach the magnitude of 1894-plague (12 million deaths) and 1918-A(H1N1) influenza (50 million deaths) pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic was heralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal coronaviruses. The suspected animal-to-human jumping of 4 betacoronaviruses including the human coronaviruses OC43(1890), SARS-CoV-1(2003), MERS-CoV(2012), and SARS-CoV-2(2019) indicates their significant pandemic potential. The presence of a large reservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating exotic mammals in highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels from these areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. The possibility of emergence of a hypothetical SARS-CoV-3 or other novel viruses from animals or laboratories, and therefore needs for global preparedness should not be ignored. We reviewed representative publications on the epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations, pathology, laboratory diagnostics, treatment, vaccination, and infection control of COVID-19 as of 20 January 2021, which is 1 year after person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was announced. The difficulties of mass testing, labour-intensive contact tracing, importance of compliance to universal masking, low efficacy of antiviral treatment for severe disease, possibilities of vaccine or antiviral-resistant virus variants and SARS-CoV-2 becoming another common cold coronavirus are discussed."
77,Congregational COVID-19 Conversations: Utilization of Medical-Religious Partnerships During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic.,"Over the last 12-months during the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued public health instructions with the hope of mitigating the spread of the virus. Through existing relationships established by an academic hospital, we established weekly community conference calls to disseminate such critical information on the pandemic and allow community leaders to discuss struggles and successes. From these calls, we were able to collaborate in a more intimate manner with faith-based organizations, whereby we emphasized and planned the role they could undertake during the pandemic. Such emphasis was made between our medical institution and various faith-based organizations through meetings titled ""Congregational COVID-19 Conversations."" Over the past 12-months, we held virtual meetings with 38 faith-based organizations: 15 Christian congregations, 21 Jewish synagogues, and 2 Islamic masjids. We describe in detail in this report a narrative summary of the meetings. From these meetings, we discussed several COVID-19-related themes that included how to have their place of worship disseminate public health messaging, aid in preparing buildings for public worship, and insight into preparing their regions for aid in both COVID-19 testing and for potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sites. This medical-religious partnership has proven feasible and valuable during the pandemic and warrants emphasis in that it has the potential to serve a vital role in mitigating COVID-19-related disparities in certain communities, as well as potentially ending the COVID-19 pandemic completely."
78,Performance characteristics of five immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2: a head-to-head benchmark comparison.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic in 2020. Testing is crucial for mitigating public health and economic effects. Serology is considered key to population-level surveillance and potentially individual-level risk assessment. However, immunoassay performance has not been compared on large, identical sample sets. We aimed to investigate the performance of four high-throughput commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays and a novel 384-well ELISA. Methods: We did a head-to-head assessment of SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA), LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy), Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), SARS-CoV-2 Total assay (Siemens, Munich, Germany), and a novel 384-well ELISA (the Oxford immunoassay). We derived sensitivity and specificity from 976 pre-pandemic blood samples (collected between Sept 4, 2014, and Oct 4, 2016) and 536 blood samples from patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collected at least 20 days post symptom onset (collected between Feb 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess assay thresholds. Findings: At the manufacturers' thresholds, for the Abbott assay sensitivity was 92·7% (95% CI 90·2-94·8) and specificity was 99·9% (99·4-100%); for the DiaSorin assay sensitivity was 96·2% (94·2-97·7) and specificity was 98·9% (98·0-99·4); for the Oxford immunoassay sensitivity was 99·1% (97·8-99·7) and specificity was 99·0% (98·1-99·5); for the Roche assay sensitivity was 97·2% (95·4-98·4) and specificity was 99·8% (99·3-100); and for the Siemens assay sensitivity was 98·1% (96·6-99·1) and specificity was 99·9% (99·4-100%). All assays achieved a sensitivity of at least 98% with thresholds optimised to achieve a specificity of at least 98% on samples taken 30 days or more post symptom onset. Interpretation: Four commercial, widely available assays and a scalable 384-well ELISA can be used for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing to achieve sensitivity and specificity of at least 98%. The Siemens assay and Oxford immunoassay achieved these metrics without further optimisation. This benchmark study in immunoassay assessment should enable refinements of testing strategies and the best use of serological testing resource to benefit individuals and population health.

79,Recent progress on rapid SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 detection by CRISPR-Cas13-based platforms.,"The limitations of conventional diagnostic procedures, such as real-time PCR-based methods and serological tests, have led the scientific community to innovate alternative nucleic acid detection approaches for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, thereby addressing the dire need for increased testing. Such approaches aim to provide rapid, accurate, cost-effective, sensitive, and high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, on multiple specimen types, and without specialized equipment and expertise. The CRISPR-Cas13 system functions as a sequence-specific RNA-sensing tool that has recently been harnessed to develop simplified and flexible testing formats. This review recapitulates technical advances in the most recent CRISPR-Cas13-based methods for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 diagnosis. The challenges and opportunities for implementing mass testing using these novel CRISPR-Cas13 platforms are critically analyzed."
80,A Single-centre Study of COVID-19 Antibody.,"ABSTARCT Four hundred and fifty-three SARS CoV-2 antibodies tests were conducted using Roche Elecsys® Anti SARS CoV-2 kits (detecting total antibodies) between June 13 to July 8, 2020 (25 days) on Cobas® e411 automatic analyser, based on electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) principle. Samples were collected from walk-in patients at our facility. Among them, 2 (0.4%) were found equivocal, 289 (63.8%) were found reactive, while 162 (35.8%) were found non-reactive. Moreover, reactive (symptomatic) cases were 262 (57.8%), reactive (asymptomatic) were 27 (6.0%), non-reactive (symptomatic) were 34 (7.5%), while non-reactive (asymptomatic) were 128 (28.3%). Most common symptom was fever, found in 262 (87.9%) individuals, followed by dry cough 146 (49.0%). Most number of reactive cases, i.e. 110 (42.6%) were those who got themselves tested between 15-21 days after onset of first symptom. Key Words: COVID-19, Coronavirus, Antibodies testing."
81,"False-positive and false-negative COVID-19 cases: respiratory prevention and management strategies, vaccination, and further perspectives.","Introduction: A novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported via nucleic acid identification in December, 2019. Accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays has emerged as a major barrier to COVID-19 diagnosis, particularly in cases requiring urgent or emergent treatment.Areas covered: In this review, we explore the major reasons for false-positive and false-negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. How clinical characteristics, specific respiratory comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination impact on existing diagnostic assays are highlighted. Different COVID-19 management algorithms based on each test and limitations are thoroughly presented.Expert opinion: The diagnostic accuracy and the capacity of every available assay, which need to be interpreted in the light of the background incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the communities in which they are used, are essential in order to minimize the number of falsely tested cases. Automated testing platforms may enhance diagnostic accuracy by minimizing the potential for human error in assays' performance. Prior immunization against SARS-CoV-2 impairs the utility of serologic testing of suspected COVID-19 cases. Future avenues of research to evaluate lung tissue innate immune responses hold promise as a target for research to optimize SARS-CoV-2 and future infections' testing accuracy."
82,Comparison of 2 fully automated tests detecting antibodies against nucleocapsid N and spike S1/S2 proteins in COVID-19.,"Automated assays for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics have recently come available. We compared the performance of the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG tests. The seroconversion panel comprised of 120 samples from 13 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. For the sensitivity and specificity testing, samples from COVID-19 outpatients >15 days after positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) result (n = 35) and serum control samples collected before the COVID-19 era (n = 161) were included in the material. Samples for the detection of possible cross-reactions were also tested. Based on our results, the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be quite reliably detected 2 weeks after NAAT positivity and 3 weeks after the symptom onset with both tests. However, since some COVID-19 patients were positive only with Elecsys®, the antibodies should be screened against N-antigen (Elecsys®) and reactive samples confirmed with S antigen (LIAISON®), but both results should be reported. In some COVID-19 patients, the serology can remain negative."
83,Community-Informed Mobile COVID-19 Testing Model to Addressing Health Inequities.,"Context: The New York City (NYC) Test & Trace Corps (Test & Trace), under New York City Health + Hospitals (NYC H+H), set out to provide universal access to COVID-19 testing. Test & Trace partnered with numerous organizations to direct mobile COVID-19 testing from concept through implementation to reduce COVID-19-related health inequities. Program: Test & Trace employs a community-informed mobile COVID-19 testing model to deliver testing to the hardest-hit, underserved communities. Community partners, uniquely knowledgeable of the residents they serve, are engaged as decision makers and operational partners in mobile COVID-19 testing delivery. Implementation: Through several mobile testing methods, community partners choose testing locations and tailor outreach to their community. Test & Trace assumes logistical responsibility for mobile testing but defers critical programmatic decisions and community engagement to partners. Integral to the success of this program is responsive, bidirectional communication. Evaluation: During the reporting period of December 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, Test & Trace's community-informed mobile COVID-19 testing model provided testing to 150351 unique patients and processed 274083 tests in total. The available outcomes data and qualitative feedback provided by community partners illustrate that this intervention, combined with robust governmental investment, successfully ensured that NYC-identified, low-resource neighborhoods had greater access to COVID-19 testing. Discussion: Making community partners decision makers reduced inequities in access to testing for communities of color. In addition, the model has served as the framework for Test & Trace's community-informed mobile COVID-19 vaccination program, operated in concert with NYC's Vaccine Command Center, and is a foundation for addressing health inequities at scale, including during public health crises."
84,"COVID-19 in a cohort of pregnant women and their descendants, the MOACC-19 study.","Purpose: The Mother and Child COVID-19 study is a cohort recruiting pregnant women and their children in Cantabria, North of Spain, during COVID-19 pandemic in order to ascertain consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women and their descendants. This article reports the cohort profile and preliminary results as recruitment is still open. Participants: Three subcohorts can be identified at recruitment. Subcohort 1 includes women giving birth between 23 March and 25 May 2020; they have been retrospectively recruited and could have been exposed to COVID-19 only in their third trimester of pregnancy. Subcohort 2 includes women giving birth from 26 May 2020 on; they are being prospectively recruited and could have been exposed to COVID-19 in both their second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Subcohort 3 includes women in their 12 week of pregnancy prospectively recruited from 26 May 2020 on; they could have been exposed to COVID-19 anytime in their pregnancy. All women are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using both RT-PCR for RNA detection and ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All neonates are being tested for antibodies using immunochemoluminiscency tests; if the mother is tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, a nasopharyngeal swab is also obtained from the child for RT-PCR analysis. Findings to date: As of 22 October, 1167 women have been recruited (266, 354 and 547 for subcohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Fourteen women tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the day of delivery. All 14 children born from these women tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Future plans: Children from women included in subcohort 3 are expected to be recruited by the end of 2020. Children will be followed-up for 1 year in order to ascertain the effect that COVID-19 on their development."
85,Nucleic acid and antibody assay results in Chinese patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"Aim: To evaluate the nucleic acid and antibody test results of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. Methods: All patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from Jan to Apr 2020were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics and laboratory test results were obtained from electronic medical records. Patients were divided into three groups based on antibody production, and compared for laboratory test results. Results: Of 73 patients aged11-82 years, 12 (16.4%), 28 (38.4%), 25 (34.2%) and 8 (11.0%)were ≤ 30, 31-50, 51-70,and ≥ 71 years old, respectively. Thirty-four (46.6%) patients were male. Most individuals had mild symptoms, and no patient died during treatment. All patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in sputum and nasopharyngeal samples, and 40 (54.8%) were also tested positive in stool. Nine(12.3%) patients were re-positivefor SARS-CoV-2, as assessed by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) after discharge. Sixty-five (89.0%) patients had IgM or IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.Among the four age groups, there was no difference in IgG antibody production (P = 0.664).CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19 cell counts between the antibody producing and non-producing groups showed no significant differences (all P > 0.05).The antibodies disappeared within two months in four patients. Lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, IL-6, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine and D-Dimer levels were similar in the three groups (all P > 0.05). Conclusions: Patients after recovery from COVID-19 can be tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.Some patients may produce antibodies only for a short time, or even no antibodies at all."
86,Comparative in silico design and validation of GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test.,"Aims: Providing a ready-to-use reverse transcriptase qPCR (RT-qPCR) method fully validated to detect the SARS-CoV-2 with a higher exclusivity than this shown by early published RT-qPCR designs. Methods and results: The specificity of the GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test by analysis of sequence alignments was approached and compared with other RT-qPCR designs. The GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test was validated following criteria of UNE/EN ISO 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189:2012. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, (Madrid, Spain), the Public Health England (Colindale, London, UK), and received the label CE-IVD. The GPS design showed the highest exclusivity and passed all parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100% correlated with these obtained by using reference methods and showed 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: The CE-IVD GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test, available worldwide with full analytical and diagnostic validation, is the more exclusive for SARS-CoV-2 by far. Significance and impact of the study: Considering the CoVID-19 pandemic status, the exclusivity of RT-qPCR tests is crucial to avoid false positives due to related coronaviruses. This work provides of a highly specific and validated RT-qPCR method for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which represents a case of efficient transfer of technology successfully used since the pandemic was declared."
87,Rapid molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 by RT-LAMP in a centrifugal polystyrene-toner based microdevice with end-point visual detection.,"Infection caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a serious worldwide public health problem, and one of the most important strategies for its control is mass testing. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has emerged as an important alternative to simplify the diagnostics of infectious diseases. In addition, an advantage of LAMP is that it allows for easy reading of the final result through visual detection. However, this step must be performed with caution to avoid contamination and false-positive results. LAMP performed on microfluidic platforms can minimize false-positive results, in addition to having potential for point-of-care applications. Here, we describe a polystyrene-toner (PS-T) centrifugal microfluidic device manually controlled by a fidget spinner for molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-LAMP, with integrated and automated colorimetric detection. The amplification was carried out in a microchamber with 5 μL capacity, and the reaction was thermally controlled with a thermoblock at 72 °C for 10 min. At the end of the incubation time, the detection of amplified RT-LAMP fragments was performed directly on the chip by automated visual detection. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to detect COVID-19 in reactions initiated with approximately 10-3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinical samples were tested using our RT-LAMP protocol as well as by conventional RT-qPCR, demonstrating comparable performance to the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay. The methodology described in this study represents a simple, rapid, and accurate method for rapid molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 in a disposable microdevice, ideal for point-of-care testing (POCT) systems."
88,Tools and Techniques for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/COVID-19 Detection.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to millions of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. Efficient diagnostic tools are in high demand, as rapid and large-scale testing plays a pivotal role in patient management and decelerating disease spread. This paper reviews current technologies used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical laboratories as well as advances made for molecular, antigen-based, and immunological point-of-care testing, including recent developments in sensor and biosensor devices. The importance of the timing and type of specimen collection is discussed, along with factors such as disease prevalence, setting, and methods. Details of the mechanisms of action of the various methodologies are presented, along with their application span and known performance characteristics. Diagnostic imaging techniques and biomarkers are also covered, with an emphasis on their use for assessing COVID-19 or monitoring disease severity or complications. While the SARS-CoV-2 literature is rapidly evolving, this review highlights topics of interest that have occurred during the pandemic and the lessons learned throughout. Exploring a broad armamentarium of techniques for detecting SARS-CoV-2 will ensure continued diagnostic support for clinicians, public health, and infection prevention and control for this pandemic and provide advice for future pandemic preparedness."
89,Diagnostic Accuracy Estimates for COVID-19 Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction and Lateral Flow Immunoassay Tests With Bayesian Latent-Class Models.,"Our objective was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), depending on the time after symptom onset. Based on the cross-classified results of RT-PCR and LFIA, we used Bayesian latent-class models, which do not require a gold standard for the evaluation of diagnostics. Data were extracted from studies that evaluated LFIA (immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or immunoglobulin M (IgM)) assays using RT-PCR as the reference method. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 0.68 (95% probability interval (PrI): 0.63, 0.73). IgG/M sensitivity was 0.32 (95% PrI :0.23; 0.41) for the first week and increased steadily. It was 0.75 (95% PrI: 0.67; 0.83) and 0.93 (95% PrI: 0.88; 0.97) for the second and third weeks after symptom onset, respectively. Both tests had a high to absolute specificity, with higher point median estimates for RT-PCR specificity and narrower probability intervals. The specificity of RT-PCR was 0.99 (95% PrI: 0.98; 1.00). and the specificity of IgG/IgM was 0.97 (95% PrI: 0.92, 1.00), 0.98 (95% PrI: 0.95, 1.00) and 0.98 (95% PrI: 0.94, 1.00) for the first, second, and third weeks after symptom onset. The diagnostic accuracy of LFIA varies with time after symptom onset. Bayesian latent-class models provide a valid and efficient alternative for evaluating the rapidly evolving diagnostics for COVID-19, under various clinical settings and different risk profiles."
90,COVID-19 serology: use and interpretation in New Zealand.,"Serology is now a well-established diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections in New Zealand. Using local and international experience, we provide an overview of serological response to infection and vaccination as well as the use and interpretation of antibody tests in our setting. We also discuss the potential future role of post-vaccination serology testing as a correlate of immunity. We conclude that, given the pitfalls of testing, clinical microbiologist advice is necessary for interpretation of high-consequence cases."
91,Prioritizing Health Care and Employment Resources During COVID-19: Roles of Benevolent and Hostile Ageism.,"Background and objectives: Benevolent and hostile ageism are subtypes of ageism that characterize older adults as incompetent. With benevolent ageism, older adults are also viewed as warm. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has strained resources and prompted debates about priority for older adults versus other groups. Research design and methods: College students completed an online survey of how much priority should be given to older adults in 3 relevant health care-related scenarios and 3 relevant employment scenarios. Results: Benevolent ageism significantly predicted higher priority for older adults to receive health care (triage, COVID-19 vaccine, and COVID-19 testing) and employment resources (retention of job and working from home) while greater endorsement of hostile ageism significantly predicted lower priority ratings. Discussion and implications: These findings replicate and extend past work. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on health care and employment resources, this study sheds light on one factor-benevolent and hostile ageism-that contributes to a greater understanding of prioritization views toward a vulnerable segment of the population."
92,Immunochromatographic test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva.,"We evaluated the rapid immunochromatographic test for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen detection using 16 saliva specimens collected from 6 COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and detected N-antigen in 4 of 7 RT-PCR positive specimens. This POCT detected SARS-CoV-2 antigen in saliva and would be useful for COVID-19 diagnosis."
93,Evaluation of three immunochromatographic tests in COVID-19 serologic diagnosis and their clinical usefulness.,"Results of three rapid immunochromatographic tests (ICTs) were compared with those obtained with two automated immunoassays for evaluation of their usefulness. One hundred fifty-nine patients and 67 healthy volunteers were included. Different assays demonstrate 41-45% of diagnostic sensitivities and 91-98% of specificities, with substantial agreement (89.3-91.2%), but a high percentage of weak positive results (13-22%) was observed with ICTs. ICTs performances were comparable to those of automated immunoassays. ICTs could have a role as screening approach due to their easy usability. Subjective interpretation, significant rate of uncertain results, uncertainty on viral antigens source are undoubtedly drawbacks."
94,Rapid and Extraction-Free Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Saliva by Colorimetric Reverse-Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification.,"Background: Rapid, reliable, and widespread testing is required to curtail the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Current gold-standard nucleic acid tests are hampered by supply shortages in critical reagents including nasal swabs, RNA extraction kits, personal protective equipment, instrumentation, and labor. Methods: To overcome these challenges, we developed a rapid colorimetric assay using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) optimized on human saliva samples without an RNA purification step. We describe the optimization of saliva pretreatment protocols to enable analytically sensitive viral detection by RT-LAMP. We optimized the RT-LAMP reaction conditions and implemented high-throughput unbiased methods for assay interpretation. We tested whether saliva pretreatment could also enable viral detection by conventional reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Finally, we validated these assays on clinical samples. Results: The optimized saliva pretreatment protocol enabled analytically sensitive extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric RT-LAMP or RT-qPCR. In simulated samples, the optimized RT-LAMP assay had a limit of detection of 59 (95% confidence interval: 44-104) particle copies per reaction. We highlighted the flexibility of LAMP assay implementation using 3 readouts: naked-eye colorimetry, spectrophotometry, and real-time fluorescence. In a set of 30 clinical saliva samples, colorimetric RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR assays performed directly on pretreated saliva samples without RNA extraction had accuracies greater than 90%. Conclusions: Rapid and extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric RT-LAMP is a simple, sensitive, and cost-effective approach with broad potential to expand diagnostic testing for the virus causing COVID-19."
95,Interpreting COVID-19 Test Results in Clinical Settings: It Depends!,"Tests for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are intended for a disparate and shifting range of purposes: (1) diagnosing patients who present with symptoms to inform individual treatment decisions; (2) organizational uses such as ""cohorting"" potentially infected patients and staff to protect others; and (3) contact tracing, surveillance, and other public health purposes. Often lost when testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in the positive or negative predictive value of the test. We conclude with practical recommendations regarding the need for testing in various contexts, appropriate tests and testing methods, and the interpretation of test results."
96,Rapid COVID-19 antigenic tests: Usefulness of a modified method for diagnosis.,"The current reliable recommended test for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis is quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Rapid antigen test devices could be useful as they are less expensive, faster without the need of specialized laboratories to perform the test. We report the performances of two rapid immunochromatographic antigen testing devices compared with RT-qPCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection in nasopharyngeal samples. We carried out a lateral-flow tests study on 401 nasopharyngeal swab samples from nonduplicated suspected COVID-19 subjects. An equal volume of universal transport medium tubes-containing samples (dilution ratio = 1:15) were added to the manufacturer's extraction buffer solution (dilution ratio = 1:2) and analyzed on BioSpeedia COVID19Speed-Antigen Test and on Abbott Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test, devices. Qualitative results were compared to those obtained by the RT-qPCR (Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2 Assay Seegene). Based on our data, the overall sensitivity for BioSpeedia and Panbio devices was estimated at 65.5% and 75.0%, respectively. The sensitivity was greater for cycle threshold values less than 25 achieving 90.4 and 96.8 for BioSpeedia and Panbio devices, respectively. A perfect specificity of 100.0% was observed for both devices."
97,Using COVID-19 cycle threshold and other lab values as predictors of hospitalization need.,"SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) is a novel virus that has caused over 28 million cases worldwide and over 900,000 deaths since early 2020, rightfully being classified as a pandemic. COVID-19 is diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction testing which looks at cycle threshold (CT) values of two genes, N2 and E. This study examined CT values of COVID-positive patients at the VA hospital in Reno as well as other lab values and comorbidities to determine if any could aid clinicians in predicting the need for hospitalization and higher levels of care. Multiple variables, including N2 CT value, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), D-dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and ferritin were evaluated for potential associations with N2 CT value as well as required level of care (based on World Health Organization [WHO] ordinal score). The results suggest that patients with a N2 CT value less than 34 are four times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p = .0021) while controlling for age and comorbidities (DM, cardiac, kidney, and lung disease). Patients of age 55 or greater were 15.18 times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p = .012) controlling for N2 CT value and comorbidities. Furthermore, patients with ALC less than 1 were 5.88 times more likely to have WHO ordinal score of 4-8 (p = .00024). N2 CT values also appear to be associated with many commonly obtained markers such as ALC, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer. Patients with N2 CT values less than 34 were 3.49 times more likely to have ALC values less than 1, controlling for age and comorbidities (p = .0072) while patients 55 or older were 6.66 times more likely to have ALC less than 1 (p = .027). Finally, this study confirms previous conclusions that patients with advanced age had more severe infections and thus will likely require higher levels of care."
98,Trends in COVID-19 Testing and Positivity Rates from a Mobile Testing Program in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area.,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a global concern, with over 150 million cases worldwide. Arizona, which was recently a hotspot for COVID-19, has over 860 thousand cases. Reviewing the COVID-19 trends over time is crucial in understanding the pandemic and evaluating the impact of mitigation techniques. This current study analyzes the trends in COVID-19 testing and positivity rates from a mobile testing program in the Phoenix metropolitan area between December 2020 and April 2021. Of the 32,234 tests performed there was a total of 3654 COVID positive cases, yielding an overall positivity rate of 11.3%. COVID-19 positivity rates were significantly higher in December (12.9%) and January (12.7%), compared to February (7.5%), March (4.9%), and April (6.7%), p < 0.05. The peak of COVID-19 cases is likely attributable to the holiday season and family gatherings, followed by a steady decline, likely due to fewer gatherings and an increase in individuals receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. Continued public health measures, including vaccinations, are critical in reducing COVID-19 transmission."
99,Guidelines on newly identified limitations of diagnostic tools for COVID-19 and consequences.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus has spread worldwide and has become the deadliest pandemic of the 21st century. Such rapid spread is predominantly attributed to the poor diagnosis and its asymptomatic transmission. In the absence of treatment regime, timely diagnosis is the best available remedy that can restrict its spread. An early diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical for determining the line of treatment and preventing long term complications in the infected subject. Unfortunately, available rapid antigen and antibody kits are known to be erroneous whereas reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction based tests are expensive, viral load dependent and at times inconclusive. In current scenario, the false-negative results imposed a major risk to the individual patient care and also to the efforts for containing the spread at the population level, where as false positives are traumatic for families and can lead to improper treatment resulting in severe complications. In this article, the limitations of available diagnostic procedures have been elaborated and plausible combination approach has been advised."
100,"Diagnostics for COVID-19: A case for field-deployable, rapid molecular tests for community surveillance.","Across the globe, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing distress with governments doing everything in their power to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to prevent morbidity and mortality. Actions are being implemented to keep health care systems from being overstretched and to curb the outbreak. Any policy responses aimed at slowing down the spread of the virus and mitigating its immediate effects on health care systems require a firm basis of information about the absolute number of currently infected people, growth rates, and locations/hotspots of infections. The only way to obtain this base of information is by conducting numerous tests in a targeted way. Currently, in Ghana, there is a centralized testing approach, that takes 4-5 days for samples to be shipped and tested at central reference laboratories with results communicated to the district, regional and national stakeholders. This delay in diagnosis increases the risk of ongoing transmission in communities and vulnerable institutions. We have validated, evaluated and deployed an innovative diagnostic tool on a mobile laboratory platform to accelerate the COVID-19 testing. A preliminary result of 74 samples from COVID-19 suspected cases has a positivity rate of 12% with a turn-around time of fewer than 3 hours from sample taking to reporting of results, significantly reducing the waiting time from days to hours, enabling expedient response by the health system for contact tracing to reduce transmission and additionally improving case management. Funding: Test kits were provided by AngloGold Ashanti Obuasi Mine (AngloGold Ashanti Health Foundation). The American Leprosy Mission donated the PCR machine, and the mobile laboratory van was funded by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (EKN). AAS, YAA was supported by (PANDORA-ID-NET RIA2016E-1609) and ROP supported by EDCTP Senior Fellowship (TMA2016SF), both funded by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP2) programme which is supported under Horizon 2020, the European Union."
101,Magnetofluidic immuno-PCR for point-of-care COVID-19 serological testing.,"Serological tests play an important role in the fight against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), including monitoring the dynamic immune response after vaccination, identifying past infection and determining community infection rate. Conventional methods for serological testing, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and chemiluminescence immunoassays, provide reliable and sensitive antibody detection but require sophisticated laboratory infrastructure and/or lengthy assay time. Conversely, lateral flow immunoassays are suitable for rapid point-of-care tests but have limited sensitivity. Here, we describe the development of a rapid and sensitive magnetofluidic immuno-PCR platform that can address the current gap in point-of-care serological testing for COVID-19. Our magnetofluidic immuno-PCR platform automates a magnetic bead-based, single-binding, and one-wash immuno-PCR assay in a palm-sized magnetofluidic device and delivers results in ∼30 min. In the device, a programmable magnetic arm attracts and transports magnetically-captured antibodies through assay reagents pre-loaded in a companion plastic cartridge, and a miniaturized thermocycler and a fluorescence detector perform immuno-PCR to detect the antibodies. We evaluated our magnetofluidic immuno-PCR with 108 clinical serum/plasma samples and achieved 93.8% (45/48) sensitivity and 98.3% (59/60) specificity, demonstrating its potential as a rapid and sensitive point-of-care serological test for COVID-19."
102,A Review on Applicable and Available Paraclinical Methods for Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease-19.,"Background: The recent outbreak by a novel coronavirus originated from Wuhan, China in 2019, and is progressively spreading to other countries. Timely diagnosis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) improves the survival of the patients and also prevents the transmission of the infection. In this study, we reviewed the applicable and available methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: For the review, we systematically searched Web of Science, PubMed, and Iranian articles that were published about COVID-19 diagnostic methods with a combination of the key terms: laboratory, radiological, tests, coronavirus. Results: Although the current gold standard diagnostic test for this virus is real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the occasional false-negative and the low sensitivity of the test should not be underestimated. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan is another diagnostic test for COVID-19, with higher sensitivity but low specificity. A combination of sensitive RT-PCR with a chest CT scan together with the clinical features are highly recommended for the proper diagnosis. Notably, there are some other sensitive and low-cost tests for evaluation of COVID-19 infection, but their validation should be approved. Conclusion: Since early and accurate diagnosis of the viral disease could improve the survival rate of the patients, and halt the transmission chain, it is not surprising that tremendous attempts should be made to reduce the limitations of the tests leading to the false-negative results and to find a rapid test for the diagnosis of COVID-19."
103,Typical CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients presenting with repetitive negative RT-PCR.,"Multiple polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard diagnostic investigation for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, false negative multiple polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results can be diagnostically challenging. We report three patients with history of fever and different clinical signs. During the height of the pandemic in Italy (March to May 2020), these patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT) scans that showed lung alterations typical of COVID-19 with multiple negative RT-PCR tests and positive serology for SARS-CoV-2. Two of the three patients showed residual pneumonia on CT after the onset of the first clinical signs. One patient presented with diarrhoea without respiratory symptoms. These cases suggest that in the COVID-19 pandemic period, to provide an earlier specific treatment in patients with positive serology, a chest CT scan can be useful in those presenting with a fever or a history of fever associated with persistent mild respiratory symptoms or with abdominal complaints despite repeated negative RT-PCR results."
104,Characteristics and predictors of hospitalization and death in the first 11 122 cases with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark: a nationwide cohort.,"Background: Population-level knowledge on individuals at high risk of severe and fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is urgently needed to inform targeted protection strategies in the general population. Methods: We examined characteristics and predictors of hospitalization and death in a nationwide cohort of all Danish individuals tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from 27 February 2020 until 19 May 2020. Results: We identified 11 122 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction-positive cases of whom 80% were community-managed and 20% were hospitalized. Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 5.2%. Age was strongly associated with fatal disease {odds ratio [OR] 15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 9-26] for 70-79 years, increasing to OR 90 (95% CI: 50-162) for ≥90 years, when compared with cases aged 50-59 years and adjusted for sex and number of co-morbidities}. Similarly, the number of co-morbidities was associated with fatal disease [OR 5.2 (95% CI: 3.4-8.0), for cases with at least four co-morbidities vs no co-morbidities] and 79% of fatal cases had at least two co-morbidities. Most major chronic diseases were associated with hospitalization, with ORs ranging from 1.3-1.4 (e.g. stroke, ischaemic heart disease) to 2.6-3.4 (e.g. heart failure, hospital-diagnosed kidney disease, organ transplantation) and with mortality with ORs ranging from 1.1-1.3 (e.g. ischaemic heart disease, hypertension) to 2.5-3.2 (e.g. major psychiatric disorder, organ transplantation). In the absence of co-morbidities, mortality was <5% in persons aged ≤80 years. Conclusions: In this nationwide population-based COVID-19 study, increasing age and multimorbidity were strongly associated with hospitalization and death. In the absence of co-morbidities, the mortality was, however, <5% until the age of 80 years."
105,Pooled Saliva Specimens for SARS-CoV-2 Testing.,"We evaluated saliva (SAL) specimens for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) testing by comparison of 459 prospectively paired nasopharyngeal (NP) or midturbinate (MT) swabs from 449 individuals with the aim of using saliva for asymptomatic screening. Samples were collected in a drive-through car line for symptomatic individuals (n = 380) and in the emergency department (ED) (n = 69). The percentages of positive and negative agreement of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab were 81.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.8% to 90.5%) and 99.8% (95% CI, 98.7% to 100%), respectively. The percent positive agreement increased to 90.0% (95% CI, 74.4% to 96.5%) when considering only samples with moderate to high viral load (cycle threshold [CT ] for the NP, ≤34). Pools of five saliva specimens were also evaluated on three platforms, bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG with ABI 7500Fast (CDC assay), Hologic Panther Fusion, and Roche Cobas 6800. The average loss of signal upon pooling was 2 to 3 CT values across the platforms. The sensitivities of detecting a positive specimen in a pool compared with testing individually were 94%, 90%, and 94% for the CDC 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR, Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay, and Cobas SARS-CoV-2 test, respectively, with decreased sample detection trending with lower viral load. We conclude that although pooled saliva testing, as collected in this study, is not quite as sensitive as NP/MT testing, saliva testing is adequate to detect individuals with higher viral loads in an asymptomatic screening program, does not require swabs or viral transport medium for collection, and may help to improve voluntary screening compliance for those individuals averse to various forms of nasal collections."
106,Clinical and Epidemiologic Evaluation of Inconclusive COVID-19 PCR Results Using a Quantitative Algorithm.,"Objectives: The inconclusive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result causes confusion and delay for infection prevention precautions and patient management. We aimed to develop a quantitative algorithm to assess and interpret these inconclusive results. Methods: We created a score-based algorithm by combining laboratory, clinical, and epidemiologic data to evaluate 69 cases with inconclusive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) PCR results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assay (18 cases) and the TaqPath assay (51 cases). Results: We determined 5 (28%) of 18 (CDC assay) and 20 (39%) of 51 (TaqPath assay) cases to be false positive. Lowering the cycle threshold cutoff from 40 to 37 in the TaqPath assay resulted in a dramatic reduction of the false-positive rate to 14%. We also showed testing of asymptomatic individuals is associated with a significantly higher probability of having a false-positive result. Conclusions: A substantial percentage of inconclusive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results can be false positive, especially among asymptomatic patients. The quantitative algorithm we created was shown to be effective and could provide a useful tool for clinicians and hospital epidemiologists to interpret inconclusive COVID-19 PCR results and provide clinical guidance when additional PCR or antibody test results are available."
107,The Microbiology of Coronaviruses.,"The end of 2019 marked the start of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic from China, which went on to envelope more than 190 countries and territories across the globe. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from a group of betacoronaviruses, is responsible for COVID-19. The virulent factors include the presence of envelope and spike proteins having receptor bonding domains (RBD). Clinical manifestations can range from mild respiratory infections to fatal outcomes. The viability of virus ranges from 3 to 72 hours. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the diagnostic test of choice in this pandemic situation. Due to the absence of specific antivirals and vaccine, adoption of preventive option can help to combat the specific life-threatening outcomes."
108,"Evaluation of clinical utility of novel coronavirus antigen detection reagent, Espline SARS-CoV-2.","Background: To prevent the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it is necessary to perform early identification and isolation of people shedding the infectious virus in biological materials with high viral loads several days prior to symptom onset. Rapid antigen tests for infectious diseases are useful to prevent the pandemic spread in clinical settings. Methods: We evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 antigen test, Espline® SARS-CoV-2 reagent, with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as reference test, using 129 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from COVID-19 hospitalized patients or from patients suspected having COVID-19-like symptoms. Out of these, 63 RT-PCR positive and 66 RT-PCR negative specimens were identified. Results: Among 63 RT-PCR positive specimens, 25 were positive in the Espline test. Test sensitivity was estimated based on the 532.4 copies/reaction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained through receiver operating characteristic analysis. When the specimens were classified based on time since symptom onset, Espline test sensitivity were 73.3% and 29.2% in specimens collected before day 9 and after day 10, respectively. Conclusion: Although the overall sensitivity of the Espline® SARS-CoV-2 reagent compared with RT-PCR is less, this antigen test can be useful in identifying people with high risk of virus transmission with high viral loads in order to prevent the pandemic and is useful for diagnosing COVID-19 within 30 min."
109,"Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in an Oropharyngeal Swab Specimen, Milan, Italy, Early December 2019.","We identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in an oropharyngeal swab specimen collected from a child with suspected measles in early December 2019, ≈3 months before the first identified coronavirus disease case in Italy. This finding expands our knowledge on timing and mapping of novel coronavirus transmission pathways."
110,Diagnostic Testing for COVID-19: Systematic Review of Meta-Analyses and Evidence-Based Algorithms.,"Background: Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19), a disease caused by infection with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic. Diagnosis is critical and diagnostic techniques include reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), serologic antibody testing, and chest computed tomography (CT). Despite rigorous meta-analyses looking into these techniques, there is no summary and additionally no algorithm to help guide diagnostic testing. Our objective is to perform a systematic review of the literature and to provide evidence-based algorithms for diagnosing or ruling out COVID-19. Methods: Data were gathered using PubMed and Ovid research databases using a predefined medical subject heading (MeSH) based search, and sources that were included in the study had their references reviewed to screen for more sources for this study. Sources were collected up to 23 August 2020. Two researchers searched through the databases for articles and data/articles meeting inclusion criteria were extracted. Results: 395 articles were identified, and 10 studies were included. Meta-analyses of diagnostic tests were included in our systematic review. An overview was then provided for each diagnostic test. Sensitivities and specificities for RT-PCR, serologic antibody tests and chest CT were collected, and the data was stratified by categorical variables. Two evidence-based algorithms were developed for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the hospitalized and ambulatory settings. Conclusions: This article provides a summary of the up-to-date efficacy of the most utilized diagnostic tests currently available for COVID-19. Additionally, this article provides evidence-based COVID-19 diagnostic algorithms for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the hospitalized and ambulatory settings."
111,Validation of the COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Virus on Stainless-Steel Surfaces: AOAC Performance Tested MethodSM 122004.,"Background: The COVID-19 Indoor Test™ by Phylagen uses a real-time PCR Assay to detect nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, which is extracted from swabs sampled from environmental surfaces. This information can be used to detect the presence of the virus in indoor environments. Objective: To validate the COVID-19 Indoor TestTM by Phylagen as part of the AOAC Research Institute's Emergency Response Validation Performance Tested Method(s)SM program. Method: The COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen assay was evaluated for specificity using in silico analysis of 15 764 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and 65 exclusivity organisms. The candidate method was also evaluated in an unpaired matrix study design for one environmental surface (stainless steel) and compared to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Revision 4, Effective 6/12/2020). Results: Results of the in silico analysis demonstrated the specificity of the method in being able to detect SARS-CoV-2 target sequences and discriminate them from near-neighbors. In the matrix study, the candidate method demonstrated statistically significant better recovery of the target analyte than the reference method (2 × 103 GU/2 × 2"" test surface). Conclusions: The COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen is a rapid and accurate method that can be utilized to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, on stainless-steel surfaces in built environments. Highlights: The COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen assay performed significantly better than the reference method when used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from environmental surfaces."
112,Comparative study of four SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) platforms demonstrates that ID NOW performance is impaired substantially by patient and specimen type.,"The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States created a unique situation where multiple molecular SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays rapidly received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA and were validated by laboratories and utilized clinically, all within a period of a few weeks. We compared the performance of four of these assays that were evaluated for use at our institution: Abbott RealTime m2000 SARS-CoV-2 Assay, DiaSorin Simplexa COVID-19 Direct, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2, and Abbott ID NOW COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal and nasal specimens were collected from 88 ED and hospital-admitted patients and tested by the four methods in parallel to compare performance. ID NOW performance stood out as significantly worse than the other 3 assays despite demonstrating comparable analytic sensitivity. Further study determined that the use of a nasal swab compared to a nylon flocked nasopharyngeal swab, as well as use in a population chronically vs. acutely positive for SARS-CoV-2, were substantial factors."
113,Diagnostic evaluation of qRT-PCR-based kit and dPCR-based kit for COVID-19.,"Background: Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is well known as a fatal disease, first discovered at Wuhan in China, ranging from mild to death, such as shortness of breath and fever. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is a crucial point in preventing global prevalence. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic competency and efficiency with the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay kit and the Dr. PCR 20 K COVID-19 Detection kit, designed based on the qRT-PCR and dPCR technologies, respectively. Methods: A total of 30 negative and 20 COVID-19 positive specimens were assigned to the diagnostic test by using different COVID-19 diagnosis kits. Diagnostic accuracy was measured by statistical testing with sensitivity, specificity, and co-efficiency calculations. Results: Comparing both diagnostic kits, we confirmed that the diagnostic results of 30 negative and 20 positive cases were the same pre-diagnostic results. The diagnostic statistics test results were perfectly matched with value (1). Cohen's Kappa coefficient was demonstrated that the given kits in two different ways were ""almost perfect"" with value (1). In evaluating the detection capability, the dilutional linearity experiments substantiate that the Dr. PCR 20 K COVID-19 Detection kit could detect SARS-CoV-2 viral load at a concentration ten times lower than that of the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay kit. Conclusions: In this study, we propose that the dPCR diagnosis using LOAA dPCR could be a powerful method for COVID-19 point-of-care tests requiring immediate diagnosis in a limited time and space through the advantages of relatively low sample concentration and small equipment size compared to conventional qRT-PCR."
114,A Comparison of Five SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Assays With Clinical Correlations.,"Objectives: Comparative assessments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) molecular assays that have been operationalized through the US Food and Drug Administration's Emergency Use Authorization process are warranted to assess real-world performance. Characteristics such as sensitivity, specificity, and false-negative rate are important to inform clinical use. Methods: We compared five SARS-CoV-2 assays using nasopharyngeal and nasal swab specimens submitted in transport media; we enriched this cohort for positive specimens, since we were particularly interested in the sensitivity and false-negative rate. Performance of each test was compared with a composite standard. Results: The sensitivities and false-negative rates of the 239 specimens that met inclusion criteria were, respectively, as follows: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019 nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, 100% and 0%; TIB MOLBIOL/Roche z 480 Assay, 96.5% and 3.5%; Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid), 97.6% and 2.4%; Simplexa COVID-19 Direct Kit (DiaSorin), 88.1% and 11.9%; and ID Now COVID-19 (Abbott), 83.3% and 16.7%. Conclusions: The assays that included a nucleic acid extraction followed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were more sensitive than assays that lacked a full extraction. Most false negatives were seen in patients with low viral loads, as extrapolated from crossing threshold values."
115,Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of mothers with COVID-19 and their neonates: vertical transmission.,"Introduction: COVID-19 disease can affect women at any stage of pregnancy, and newborns could become infected with SARS-CoV-2 through vertical or horizontal transmission. Objective: To determine clinical and epidemiological characteristics of mothers with COVID-19, associated neonatal outcomes, and to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission. Methods: We conducted an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study. We included all mothers with positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 and their newborns at the Hospital Regional Docente de Trujillo from April 18 to September 30, 2020. Variables were collected from the medical records, and descriptive statistics were used for the analysis. Results: A total of 647 mothers and 656 neonates were enrolled. Of all live births, 85.3% and 14.7% were term and preterm neonates, respectively. We found 1.7% (11/656) of newborns with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2; and that 27.3% (3/11) of these neonates required hospitalization. Neonatal mortality was 4/656 (0.6%), and no case was attributed to COVID-19. Of all mothers affected with COVID-19, 95.7% were asymptomatic, and 4.3% presented clinical symptoms attributed to COVID-19, most of which were mild. The most frequent obstetric complications were preeclampsia-eclampsia, prelabour rupture of membranes, and acute fetal distress. All the mothers were discharged. Conclusion: We found 1.7% of newborns with positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; and that 20.1% of these neonates were hospitalized. The most frequent morbidity was neonatal sepsis and prematurity. The infection was mild among newborns, showing a 0.6% overall mortality, with no cases attributed to COVID-19. We found that only 5% of mothers presented symptoms, most of which were mild to moderate symptoms. There was no record of maternal mortality in this study group. It is not possible to conclude whether vertical transmission or intrapartum-acquired infection is responsible for neonatal COVID-19 infections."
116,"Orthogonal antibody testing for COVID-19 among healthcare workers in a non-epidemic place and time:Japan's Iwate Prefecture, May 18-31, 2020.","Of the 47 prefectures in Japan, Iwate had the fewest cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first diagnosis officially confirmed on July 28, 2020. A baseline serological survey of COVID-19 antibodies is essential to accurately evaluate an epidemic outbreak. The primary purpose of this study was to determine pre-epidemic prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among healthcare workers, using two laboratory-based quantitative tests. In addition, a point-of-care (POC) qualitative test, rapid, simple, and convenient for primary care clinics, was compared with the laboratory-based tests. All antibody tests were performed on serum from 1,000 healthcare workers (mean age, 40 ± 11 years) in Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital, May 29-31, 2020. A COVID-19 case was defined as showing positive results in both laboratory-based quantitative tests. None of 1,000 samples had positive results in both of the laboratory immunoassays. The POC test showed positive results in 33 of 1,000 samples (3.3%) (95% confidence interval:2.19-4.41), but no samples were simultaneously positive in both laboratory-based tests. In conclusion, COVID-19 cases were not serologically confirmed by a baseline control study of healthcare workers at our hospital in late May, 2020. Moreover, the POC qualitative test may offer no advantage in areas with very low prevalence of COVID-19, due to higher false-positive reactions compared with laboratory-based quantitative immunoassays."
117,"Effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 COVID-19 vaccination at preventing hospitalisations in people aged at least 80 years: a test-negative, case-control study.","Background: On Dec 8, 2020, deployment of the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination authorised for UK use (BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine) began, followed by an adenoviral vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 on Jan 4, 2021. Care home residents and staff, frontline health-care workers, and adults aged 80 years and older were vaccinated first. However, few data exist regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines in older people with many comorbidities. In this post-implementation evaluation of two COVID-19 vaccines, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of one dose in reducing COVID-19-related admissions to hospital in people of advanced age. Methods: This prospective test-negative case-control study included adults aged at least 80 years who were admitted to hospital in two NHS trusts in Bristol, UK with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Patients who developed symptoms before receiving their vaccine or those who received their vaccine after admission to hospital were excluded, as were those with symptoms that started more than 10 days before hospital admission. We did logistic regression analysis, controlling for time (week), sex, index of multiple deprivations, and care residency status, and sensitivity analyses matched for time and sex using a conditional logistic model adjusting for index of multiple deprivations and care residency status. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 39557. Findings: Between Dec 18, 2020, and Feb 26, 2021, 466 adults were eligible (144 test-positive and 322 test-negative). 18 (13%) of 135 people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 90 (34%) of 269 controls received one dose of BNT162b2. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 71·4% (95% CI 46·5-90·6). Nine (25%) of 36 people with COVID-19 infection and 53 (59%) of 90 controls received one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 80·4% (95% CI 36·4-94·5). When BNT162b2 effectiveness analysis was restricted to the period covered by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the estimate was 79·3% (95% CI 47·0-92·5). Interpretation: One dose of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 resulted in substantial risk reductions of COVID-19-related hospitalisation in people aged at least 80 years. Funding: Pfizer."
118,"A retrospective analysis of 12,400 SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests in patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan.","The outbreak and widely spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern. COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented and profound impact on the whole world, and the prevention and control of COVID-19 is a global public health challenge remains to be solved. The retrospective analysis of the large scale tests of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may indicate some important information of this pandemic. We selected 12400 SARS-CoV-2 tests detected in Wuhan in the first semester of 2020 and made a systematic analysis of them, in order to find some beneficial clue for the consistent prevention and control of COVID-19.SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in suspected COVID-19 patients with real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The patients' features including gender, age, type of specimen, source of patients, and the dynamic changes of the clinical symptoms were recorded and statistically analyzed. Quantitative and qualitive statistical analysis were carried out after laboratory detection.The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 33.02% in 12,400 suspected patients' specimens in Wuhan at the first months of COVID-19 epidemics. SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test of nasopharyngeal swabs might produce 4.79% (594/12400) presumptive results. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was significantly different between gender, age, type of specimen, source of patients, respectively (P < .05). The median window period from the occurrence of clinical symptom or close contact with COVID-19 patient to the first detection of positive PCR was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-4 days). The median interval time from the first SARS-CoV-2 positive to the turning negative was 14 days (interquartile range, 8-19.25 days).This study reveals the comprehensive characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from multiple perspectives, and it provides important clues and may also supply useful suggestions for future work of the prevention and treatment of COVID-19."
119,Evaluation of two rapid antigen tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital setting.,"Successful containment strategies for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will depend on reliable diagnostic assays. Point-of-care antigen tests (POCT) may provide an alternative to time-consuming PCR tests to rapidly screen for acute infections on site. Here, we evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests: the STANDARD™ F COVID-19 Ag FIA (FIA) and the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). For diagnostic assessment, we used a large set of PCR-positive and PCR-negative respiratory swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and health care workers in the setting of two University Hospitals in Munich, Germany, i.e. emergency rooms, patient care units or employee test centers. For FIA, overall clinical sensitivity and specificity were 45.4% (n = 381) and 97.8% (n = 360), respectively, and for RAT, 50.3% (n = 445) and 97.7% (n = 386), respectively. For primary diagnosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, diagnostic sensitivities were 60.9% (FIA) (n = 189) and 64.5% (RAT) (n = 256). This questions these tests' utility for the reliable detection of acute SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, in particular in high-risk settings. We support the proposal that convincing high-quality outcome data on the impact of false-negative and false-positive antigen test results need to be obtained in a POCT setting. Moreover, the efficacy of alternative testing strategies to complement PCR assays must be evaluated by independent laboratories, prior to widespread implementation in national and international test strategies."
120,CT scan chest findings in symptomatic COVID-19 patients: a reliable alternative for diagnosis.,"Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 pneumonia shows typical CT Scan features which can aid diagnoses and therefore help in the early detection and isolation of infected patients. CT scanners are readily available in many parts of Ghana. It is able to show findings typical for COVID-19 infection of the chest, even in instances where Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) misses the diagnosis. Little is known about the diagnostic potential of chest CT scan and COVID-19 among physicians even though CT scan offers a high diagnostic accuracy."
121,Comparing two sample pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection for efficient screening of COVID-19.,"The emerging pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 200 countries and resulted in a shortage of diagnostic resources globally. Rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital to control the spreading of the disease, which, however, is challenged by limited detection capacity and low detection efficiency in many parts of the world. The pooling test may offer an economical and effective approach to increase the virus testing capacity of medical laboratories without requiring more laboratory resources such as laboratory workers, testing reagents, and equipment. In this study, the sample pools of 6 and 10 were detected by a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay targeting ORF1ab and N genes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Each pool consisted of five or nine negative SARS-CoV-2 samples and one positive counterpart with varying viral loads. Two different strategies of sample pooling were investigated and the results were compared comprehensively. One approach was to pool the viral transport medium of the samples in the laboratory, and the other was to pool swab samples during the collection process. For swab pooling strategy, qualitative results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, specific tests of ORF1ab and N genes, remained stable over the different pool sizes. Together, this study demonstrates that the swab pooling strategy may serve as an effective and economical approach for screening SARS-CoV-2 infections in large populations, especially in countries and regions where medical resources are limited during the pandemic and may thus be potential for clinical laboratory applications."
122,Performance assessment of 11 commercial serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 on hospitalised COVID-19 patients.,"Background: Commercial availability of serological tests to evaluate immunoglobulins (Ig) targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has grown exponentially since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Thorough validation of these tests is important before use as epidemiological tools to infer seroprevalence in specific populations and as diagnostic tools to complement molecular approaches (e.g., quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). Methods: Commercial serological tests from 11 suppliers were assayed side-by-side using 126 samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected inpatients and 36 from healthy and HIV-infected individuals. Results: The majority of the tests assayed have >95% specificity. For the sensitivity calculation, samples were stratified by days since symptoms onset; sensitivity peaks at 16-21 days for IgM and IgA (maximum 91.2%, Euroimmun) and, dependant on the test, at 16-21 or >21 days for IgG (maximum 94.1%, Snibe). Data from semiquantitative tests show that patients with a severe clinical presentation have lower levels of Ig targeting SARS-CoV-2 at <10 days since symptoms onset and higher levels at >21 days, compared to patients with a non-severe presentation. Conclusions: This study highlights the heterogeneity of sensitivity and generally high specificity of the serological tests and establishes a basis for their usefulness to complement diagnostic techniques and population seroprevalence studies."
123,Serological Testing Reveals the Hidden COVID-19 Burden among Health Care Workers Experiencing a SARS-CoV-2 Nosocomial Outbreak.,"We describe the results of testing health care workers, from a tertiary care hospital in Japan that had experienced a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak during the first peak of the pandemic, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody seroconversion. Using two chemiluminescent immunoassays and a confirmatory surrogate virus neutralization test, serological testing revealed that a surprising 42% of overlooked COVID-19 diagnoses (27/64 cases) occurred when case detection relied solely on SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Our results suggest that the NAAT-positive population is only the tip of the iceberg and the portion left undetected might potentially have led to silent transmissions and triggered the spread. A questionnaire-based risk assessment was further indicative of exposures to specific aerosol-generating procedures (i.e., noninvasive ventilation and airway suctioning) having mediated transmission and served as the origins of the outbreak. Our observations are supportive of a multitiered testing approach, including the use of serological diagnostics, in order to accomplish exhaustive case detection along the whole COVID-19 spectrum. IMPORTANCE We describe the results of testing frontline health care workers, from a hospital in Japan that had experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Antibody testing revealed that a surprising 42% of overlooked COVID-19 diagnoses occurred when case detection relied solely on PCR-based viral detection. COVID-19 clusters have been continuously striking the health care system around the globe. Our findings illustrate that such clusters are lined with hidden infections eluding detection with diagnostic PCR and that the cluster burden in total is more immense than actually recognized. The mainstays of diagnosing infectious diseases, including COVID-19, generally consist of two approaches, one aiming to detect molecular fragments of the invading pathogen and the other to measure immune responses of the host. Considering antibody testing as one trustworthy option to test our way through the pandemic can aid in the exhaustive case detection of COVID-19 patients with variable presentations."
124,SARS-CoV-2 testing disparities across geographical regions from a large metropolitan area in Brazil: Results from a web-based survey among individuals interested in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines.,"After more than a year since the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 or COVID-19 has reached the status of a global pandemic, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in Brazil. As no effective treatment been approved yet, only mass vaccination can stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and end the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates are under development and some are currently in use. This study aims to describe the characteristics of individuals who have registered in an online platform to participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, participants' characteristics according to age and presence of comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and differences of SARS-CoV-2 testing across different geographical areas/neighborhoods are provided. This was a cross-sectional web-based study conducted between September and December/2020, aiming to reach individuals aged ≥18 years who live in Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, Brazil. Among 21,210 individuals who completed the survey, 20,587 (97.1%) were willing to participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines. Among those willing to participate, 57.8% individuals were aged 18-59 years and had no comorbidity, 33.7% were aged 18-59 years and had at least one comorbidity, and 8.6% were aged ≥ 60 years regardless the presence of any comorbidity. Almost half (42.6%) reported ever testing for COVID-19, and this proportion was lower among those aged ≥ 60 years (p < 0.001). Prevalence of positive PCR results was 16.0%, higher among those aged 18-59 years (p < 0.009). Prevalence of positive antibody result was 10.0%, with no difference across age and comorbidity groups. Participants from areas/neighborhoods with higher Human Development Index (HDI) reported ever testing for SARS-CoV-2 more frequently than those from lower HDI areas. Interest to participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines candidates in Rio de Janeiro was significantly high. The online registry successfully reached out a large number of individuals with diverse sociodemographic, economic and clinical backgrounds."
125,Neutralizing Antibodies in COVID-19 Patients and Vaccine Recipients after Two Doses of BNT162b2.,"The evaluation of the neutralizing capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is important because they represent real protective immunity. In this study we aimed to measure and compare the neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients and in vaccinated individuals. One-hundred and fifty long-term samples from 75 COVID-19 patients were analyzed with a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) and compared to six different SARS-CoV-2 serology assays. The agreement between the sVNT and pseudovirus VNT (pVNT) results was found to be excellent (i.e., 97.2%). The NAb response was also assessed in 90 individuals who had received the complete dose regimen of BNT162b2. In COVID-19 patients, a stronger response was observed in moderate-severe versus mild patients (p-value = 0.0006). A slow decay in NAbs was noted in samples for up to 300 days after diagnosis, especially in moderate-severe patients (r = -0.35, p-value = 0.03). In the vaccinated population, 83.3% of COVID-19-naive individuals had positive NAbs 14 days after the first dose and all were positive 7 days after the second dose, i.e., at day 28. In previously infected individuals, all were already positive for NAbs at day 14. At each time point, a stronger response was observed for previously infected individuals (p-value < 0.05). The NAb response remained stable for up to 56 days in all participants. Vaccinated participants had significantly higher NAb titers compared to COVID patients. In previously infected vaccine recipients, one dose might be sufficient to generate sufficient neutralizing antibodies."
126,Clinical Performance of the Point-of-Care cobas Liat for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 Minutes: a Multicenter Study.,"Highly accurate testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the point of care (POC) is an unmet diagnostic need in emergency care and time-sensitive outpatient care settings. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) technology is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. We performed a multisite U.S. study comparing the clinical performance of the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized POC RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 min, the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B nucleic acid test, to the most widely used RT-PCR laboratory test, the cobas 68/8800 SARS-CoV-2 test. Clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 444 patients with 357 evaluable specimens at five U.S. clinical laboratories were enrolled from 21 September 2020 to 23 October 2020. The overall agreement between the Liat and 68/8800 systems for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics was 98.6% (352/357). Using Liat, positive percent agreement for SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (162/162) and the negative percent agreement was 97.4% (190/195). The Liat is an RT-PCR POC test that provides highly accurate SARS-CoV-2 results in 20 min with performance equivalent to that of high-throughput laboratory molecular testing. Rapid RT-PCR testing at the POC can enable more timely infection control and individual care decisions for coronavirus disease 2019."
127,"The performance of point-of-care antibody test for COVID-19 diagnosis in a tertiary hospital in Bandung, Indonesia.","Introduction: We aim to describe the performance of combined IgM and IgG point-of-care antibody test (POC-Ab) (Wondfo®) compared to real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) (Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay) in detecting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methodology: We compared POC-Ab with rRT-PCR results among patients in a tertiary hospital from January to March 2020 in Bandung, Indonesia. We selected presumptive COVID-19 patients with positive rRT-PCR consecutively and 20 patients with negative rRT-PCR results were selected randomly from the same group of patients as controls. We described the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) with corresponding 95% confidence interval using serum and capillary blood samples. We also tested POC-Ab using non-COVID-19 (confirmed dengue and typhoid) patients' sera. Results: Twenty-seven patients with positive rRT-PCR result and 20 negative controls were included (68.1% males, mean age 46 (SD: 15.4)). Using the serum, the sensitivity of the POC-Ab was 63.0% (42.4-80.6), specificity was 95.0% (75.1-99.9), PPV was 94.4% (72.7-99.8), NPV was 65.5% (45.7-82.1). A subset of 20 patients was tested using a capillary blood sample. The accuracy of the capillary blood sample is lower compared to serum (50.0% vs. 78.7%). None of the non-COVID-19 sera tested were reactive. Conclusions: POC-Ab for COVID-19 has a high specificity with no false-positive result in non-COVID-19 sera. Therefore, it can be used to guide diagnostic among symptomatic patients in resource limited settings. Given its low sensitivity, patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 but non-reactive result should be prioritized for rRT-PCR testing."
128,RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test for point-of-care clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.,"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights the shortcomings of the current testing paradigm for viral disease diagnostics. Here, we report a stepwise protocol for an RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test for rapid and naked-eye molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. The test employs a unique dual-prong approach that integrates nucleic acid (NA) amplification and plasmonic sensing for point-of-care detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a sample-to-assay response time of <1 h. The RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test utilizes plasmonic gold nanoparticles capped with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a colorimetric reporter to detect the amplified nucleic acid from the COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. The ASOs are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, and binding of the ASOs to their target sequence results in the aggregation of the plasmonic gold nanoparticles. This highly specific agglomeration step leads to a change in the plasmonic response of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, when tested using clinical samples, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the test were found to be >98.4%, >96.6% and 100%, respectively, with a detection limit of 10 copies/μL. The test can easily be adapted to diagnose other viral infections with a simple modification of the ASOs and primer sequences. It also provides a low-cost, rapid approach requiring minimal instrumentation that can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at point-of-care settings in resource-poor situations. The colorimetric readout of the test can even be monitored using a handheld optical reader to obtain a quantitative response. Therefore, we anticipate that this protocol will be widely useful for the development of biosensors for the molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases."
129,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in an area of northeastern Italy with a high incidence of COVID-19 cases: a population-based study.,"Objectives: A seroprevalence study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was conducted in a high-incidence area located in northeastern Italy. Methods: All citizens above 10 years of age resident in five municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Trento, with the highest incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, were invited to participate in the study. Among 6098 participants, 6075 sera and a standardized questionnaire administered face-to-face were collected between 5 May and 15 May 2020 and examined. Symptomatic individuals and their family contacts were tested by RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using an Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, which was performed on the Abbott Architect i2000SR automated analyser. Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion of positive results among the total number tested. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to assess the relationship between seropositive versus seronegative individuals for a set of explanatory variables. Results: A total of 1402 participants were positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a prevalence of 23.1% (1402/6075). The highest prevalence was found in the age class 40-49 years. Overall, 34.4% (2096/6098) of the participants reported at least one symptom. The ratio between reported cases identified by molecular test and those with seropositive results was 1:3, with a maximum ratio of about 1:7 in the age group <20 years and a minimum around 1:1 in those >70 years old. The infection fatality rate was 2.5% (35/1402). Among the symptoms, anosmia and ageusia were strongly associated with seropositivity. Conclusions: The estimated seroprevalence of 23% was three-fold higher than the number of cases reported in the COVID-19 Integrated Surveillance data in the study area. This may be explained in part by a relatively high number of individuals presenting mild or no illness, especially those of younger age, and people who did not seek medical care or testing, but who may contribute to virus transmission in the community."
130,Evaluation of a rapid antigen detection test (Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device) as a point-of-care diagnostic tool for COVID-19 in a pediatric emergency department.,"We evaluated the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device as a point-of-care diagnostic tool for COVID-19 in 357 patients at a pediatric emergency department. Thirty-four patients tested positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, of which 24 were positive by the antigen assay. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 70.5% and 100%, respectively."
131,Effectiveness of the CoronaVac vaccine in older adults during a gamma variant associated epidemic of covid-19 in Brazil: test negative case-control study.,"Objective: To estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated whole virus vaccine, CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech), against symptomatic covid-19 in the elderly population of São Paulo state, Brazil during widespread circulation of the gamma variant. Design: Test negative case-control study. Setting: Community testing for covid-19 in São Paulo state, Brazil. Participants: 43 774 adults aged ≥70 years who were residents of São Paulo state and underwent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 from 17 January to 29 April 2021. 26 433 cases with symptomatic covid-19 and 17 622 test negative controls with covid-19 symptoms were formed into 13 283 matched sets, one case with to up to five controls, according to age, sex, self-reported race, municipality of residence, previous covid-19 status, and date of RT-PCR test (±3 days). Intervention: Vaccination with a two dose regimen of CoronaVac. Main outcome measures: RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic covid-19 and associated hospital admissions and deaths. Results: Adjusted vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic covid-19 was 24.7% (95% confidence interval 14.7% to 33.4%) at 0-13 days and 46.8% (38.7% to 53.8%) at ≥14 days after the second dose. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions was 55.5% (46.5% to 62.9%) and against deaths was 61.2% (48.9% to 70.5%) at ≥14 days after the second dose. Vaccine effectiveness ≥14 days after the second dose was highest for the youngest age group (70-74 years)-59.0% (43.7% to 70.2%) against symptomatic disease, 77.6% (62.5% to 86.7%) against hospital admissions, and 83.9% (59.2% to 93.7%) against deaths-and declined with increasing age. Conclusions: Vaccination with CoronaVac was associated with a reduction in symptomatic covid-19, hospital admissions, and deaths in adults aged ≥70 years in a setting with extensive transmission of the gamma variant. Vaccine protection was, however, low until completion of the two dose regimen, and vaccine effectiveness was observe to decline with increasing age among this elderly population."
132,Ravaging SARS-CoV-2: rudimentary diagnosis and puzzling immunological responses.,"Introduction: In December 2019, the first COVID-19 case, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China. The SARS-CoV-2 rapidly disseminated throughout the world via community spread, acquiring pandemic status with significant fatality. Observations: Rapid SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was soon perceived critical for arresting community spread and effective therapy development. Human SARS-CoV-2 infection can be diagnosed either by nucleic acid identification or specific antibody detection. Contrary to nucleic acid identification confirmed active SARS-CoV-2 infection; antibody detection confirms a past infection, even in asymptomatic subjects. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies augment the ability to effectively counter the virus. A crucial hurdle limiting the steadfast implementation of antibody detection is the time required for threshold B lymphocyte population generation. This process is dependent on precise antigen recognition and MHC class I molecules presentation. Conclusions: Thus, nucleic acid and antibody dependent tests complement each other in identifying human SARS-CoV-2 infection and shaping up subsequent immunological responses. This article discusses the complimentary association of nucleic acid identification (corresponding to an active infection) and antibody testing (the yester CoV-2 infection vulnerability) as the diagnostic and screening measures of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Highlights Nucleic acid (RNA) identification and specific antibody detection against SARS-CoV-2 are the noted diagnostic mechanisms for screening human SARS-CoV-2 infection. While nucleic acid identification screens prevailing SARS-CoV-2 infection, detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies signifies a past infection, even in asymptomatic subjects. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 provide a potential therapeutic option via transfer from antibody rich plasma of a recovered subject to an infected individual. Nucleic acid identification may not absolutely confirm the infection because of frequent SARS-CoV-2 genome mutations and possible technical errors, while specific antibody detection also needs at least (8-14) days for detectable screening of B-cell generated antibodies. Nucleic acid and antibody tests are complementary to each other as an early stage diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible therapy (antibodies). Sufferers with a high clinical suspicion but negative RT-PCR screening could be examined via combined imaging and repeated swab test."
133,Independent Side-by-Side Validation and Comparison of 4 Serological Platforms for SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Testing.,"Highly sensitive and specific platforms for the detection of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies are becoming increasingly important for evaluating potential SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donors, studying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and identifying individuals with seroconversion. This study provides a comparative validation of 4 anti-SARS-CoV-2 platforms. A unique feature of the study is the use of a representative cohort of convalescent patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and a mild to moderate disease course. All platforms showed significant correlations with a SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test, with highest sensitivities for the Euroimmun and the Roche platforms, suggesting their preferential use for screening persons at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections."
134,"Effectiveness of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 covid-19 vaccines against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe covid-19 outcomes in Ontario, Canada: test negative design study.","Objective: To estimate the effectiveness of mRNA covid-19 vaccines against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes (hospital admission or death). Design: Test negative design study. Setting: Ontario, Canada between 14 December 2020 and 19 April 2021. Participants: 324 033 community dwelling people aged ≥16 years who had symptoms of covid-19 and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Interventions: BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. Main outcome measures: Laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and hospital admissions and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable logistic regression was adjusted for personal and clinical characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine receipt to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes. Results: Of 324 033 people with symptoms, 53 270 (16.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 21 272 (6.6%) received at least one dose of vaccine. Among participants who tested positive, 2479 (4.7%) were admitted to hospital or died. Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection observed ≥14 days after one dose was 60% (95% confidence interval 57% to 64%), increasing from 48% (41% to 54%) at 14-20 days after one dose to 71% (63% to 78%) at 35-41 days. Vaccine effectiveness observed ≥7 days after two doses was 91% (89% to 93%). Vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission or death observed ≥14 days after one dose was 70% (60% to 77%), increasing from 62% (44% to 75%) at 14-20 days to 91% (73% to 97%) at ≥35 days, whereas vaccine effectiveness observed ≥7 days after two doses was 98% (88% to 100%). For adults aged ≥70 years, vaccine effectiveness estimates were observed to be lower for intervals shortly after one dose but were comparable to those for younger people for all intervals after 28 days. After two doses, high vaccine effectiveness was observed against variants with the E484K mutation. Conclusions: Two doses of mRNA covid-19 vaccines were observed to be highly effective against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes. Vaccine effectiveness of one dose was observed to be lower, particularly for older adults shortly after the first dose."
135,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Mitigation Efforts and Testing During an In-Person Training Event-Uganda, 12-29 October 2020.","Large public-health training events may result in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Universal SARS-CoV-2 testing during trainings for the Uganda Population-based HIV Impact Assessment identified 28 of 475 (5.9%) individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among attendees; most (89.3%) were asymptomatic. Until COVID-19 vaccine is readily available for staff and participants, effective COVID-19 mitigation measures, along with SARS-CoV-2 testing, are recommended for in-person trainings, particularly when trainees will have subsequent contact with survey participants."
136,Clinical Characteristics Associated with Return Visits to the Emergency Department after COVID-19 Diagnosis.,"Introduction: Patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) require significant healthcare resources. While published research has shown clinical characteristics associated with severe illness from COVID-19, there is limited data focused on the emergency department (ED) discharge population. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of all ED-discharged patients from Wake Forest Baptist Health and Wake Forest Baptist Health Davie Medical Center between April 25-August 9, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from a nasopharyngeal swab using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients who were discharged and had return visits within 30 days to those patients who did not return to the ED within 30 days. Results: Our study included 235 adult patients who had an ED-performed SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR positive test and were subsequently discharged on their first ED visit. Of these patients, 57 (24.3%) had return visits to the ED within 30 days for symptoms related to COVID-19. Of these 57 patients, on return ED visits 27 were admitted to the hospital and 30 were not admitted. Of the 235 adult patients who were discharged, 11.5% (27) eventually required admission for COVID-19-related symptoms. With 24.3% patients having a return ED visit after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and 11.5% requiring eventual admission, it is important to understand clinical characteristics associated with return ED visits. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis of the clinical characteristics with independent association resulting in a return ED visit, which demonstrated the following: diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 2.990, 95% confidence interval [CI, 1.21-7.40, P = 0.0179); transaminitis (OR 8.973, 95% CI, 2.65-30.33, P = 0.004); increased pulse at triage (OR 1.04, 95% CI, 1.02-1.07, P = 0.0002); and myalgia (OR 4.43, 95% CI, 2.03-9.66, P = 0.0002). Conclusion: As EDs across the country continue to treat COVID-19 patients, it is important to understand the clinical factors associated with ED return visits related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified key clinical characteristics associated with return ED visits for patients initially diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection: diabetes mellitus; increased pulse at triage; transaminitis; and complaint of myalgias."
137,Rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection potentiates early diagnosis of COVID-19 disease.,"As the COVID-19 epidemic is still ongoing, a more rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection such as viral antigen-detection needs to be evaluated for early diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Here, we report the dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients and its association with the viral nucleic acid clearance and clinical outcomes. Eighty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens, including 57 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative cases and 28 antibody positive cases. The viral antigen could be detected in 52.63% (30/57) patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the first 5 days after disease onset (p = 0.0018) and disappeared in about 8 days after disease onset. Viral antigens were highly detectable in patients with low Ct value (less than 30) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCT assay, suggesting the expression of viral antigen was associated with high viral load. Furthermore, positive antigen detection indicated disease progression, nine cases with positive antigen (9/30, 30.0%), in contrast to two cases (2/27, 7.40%) (p = 0.0444) with negative antigen, which progressed into severe disease. Thus, the viral antigens were persistent in early stages of infection when virus was in highly replicating status, and viral antigen detection promises to rapidly screen positive patients in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
138,Clinical characteristics and viral load dynamics of COVID-19 in a mildly or moderately symptomatic outpatient sample.,"Background: Studies of outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19 are uncommon. We studied: 1) association of symptoms with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results; and 2) association of initial RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) in relation to duration of RT-PCR positivity in outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19. Methods: This was a cohort study of outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 and at least one symptom. Participants had repeat nasopharyngeal swabs and symptom checklists every 3-5 days until two consecutive RT-PCR tests were negative. RT-PCR tests were used to assess viral load. Antibody tests for COVID-19 were performed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after symptom onset. Results: Twenty-five patients (nine females) were enrolled, ranging in age from 19-58 (median age 28 years). All patients reported at least one symptom, with a median of six symptoms per patient. Symptoms persisted for 6-67 days (median duration 18 days). In all 25 patients, blood samples collected a median of 13 days after symptom onset were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 15 (60%). After a median of 28 days following symptom onset, 23/23 patients with available samples tested positive for antibodies. The longest duration of positive RT-PCR test was 49 days from first positive PCR test (Mean = 27.4, SD = 12.5, Median = 24). Initial Ct was significantly associated with longer duration (β = -1.3, SE = 0.3, p<0.01 per 1 cycle higher) of RT-PCR positivity. Conclusions: In mildly or moderately ill COVID-19 outpatients, RT-PCT tests remained positive for as long as 49 days and test positivity and symptom duration correlated with initial viral load."
139,"Recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a more severe case after mild COVID-19, reversion of RT-qPCR for positive and late antibody response: Case report.","In general, SARS‐CoV‐2 replication in the host reaches its peak in the first week of infection, decreasing rapidly afterwards, while some level of immunity is build up. Yet, the infection seems to follow a distinctive course in some individuals, reactivating after the apparent resolution of symptoms1‐3. We report here the first case to be disclosed of a more vigorous COVID‐19 recurrence with SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA redetection and late antibody response, and also the first to address COVID‐19 recurrence in Brazil.

140,Collection of lower respiratory specimen by bronchoscopy for the diagnosis of COVID-19.,"Bronchoscopy, as an aerosol-generating procedure, is not routinely performed in patients with high-risk of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) owing to potential transmission to healthcare workers. However, to obtain lower respiratory specimens from bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is necessary to confirm COVID-19 or other diagnosis that will change clinical management. We report a case of diagnostic difficulty with five negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing in four upper respiratory tract and one stool samples following presentation with fever during the quarantine period and a strong epidemiological linkage to an index patient with COVID-19. The final diagnosis was confirmed by BAL. Special precautions to be taken when performing bronchoscopy in high-risk non-intubated patients were discussed."
141,Keeping up with COVID: identification of New Zealand's earliest known cluster of COVID-19 cases.,"We report the earliest known cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection so far reported, which occurred in New Zealand in late February 2020. The cluster includes one confirmed and five probable cases. The cluster was identified while investigating a weak positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that was returned by a male in his 60s in September 2020. The PCR result, combined with a clear clinical and epidemiological history of a COVID-19 like illness in late February 2020, prompted serological testing. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected and supported historical infection. Serology was also reactive for five close contacts who had also experienced a COVID-19 like illness in February 2020. Combined case histories and investigations suggest that this local cluster was import related, with the index case identified as a family member visiting from Italy in February. Case investigation also suggests this cluster was active in New Zealand prior to any previously documented local cases, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 was present and local transmission was occurring earlier than initially suspected. A weak positive PCR result, six months after acute infection, supports international evidence that SARS-CoV-2 genetic material can be detected for several months after initial COVID-19 infection, and that this is not necessarily indicative of infectivity."
142,Salivary testing of COVID-19: evaluation of serological testing following positive salivary results.,"Background: Salivary detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been proposed as an alternative to nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab testing. Our group previously published a study demonstrating that both testing methods identified SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection methodology. We therefore conducted a follow-up study using antibody testing to evaluate the accuracy of saliva versus swabs for COVID-19 detection and the durability of antibody response. Methods: Venous blood samples were collected from consenting participants and the presence of serum antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated on a large, automated immunoassay platform by the Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 qualitative assay (Roche Diagnostics, Laval Quebec). Individuals with a serum antibody cut-off index (COI) ≥ 1.0 were considered positive. Results: In asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients with a previously positive standard swab and/or saliva SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test, 42 demonstrated antibodies with 13 patients positive by swab alone, and 8 patients positive by saliva alone. Conclusions: Despite their status as 'current standard' for COVID-19 testing, these findings highlight limitations of PCR-based tests."
143,"Field evaluation of COVID-19 antigen tests versus RNA based detection: Potential lower sensitivity compensated by immediate results, technical simplicity, and low cost.","One year into the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, diagnostic strategies, although central for contact tracing and other preventive measures, are still limited. To meet the global demand, lower cost and faster antigen tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection are a convenient alternative to the gold standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. We tested laboratory-based RT-PCR RNA detection and two rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests, based on the immunochromatography test for nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Ag ECO Test, ECO Diagnóstica, and Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Abbott). Paired collection and testing were done in a small prospective open study in three clinical services in São Paulo, constituted of mostly symptomatic volunteers at collection (97%, 109/112) for a median of 4 days (interquartile range: 3-6), ranging from 1 to 30. Among the 108 paired RT-PCR/RAD tests, results were concordant in 96.4% (101/108). The test's performance was comparable, with an overall sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96%. These observations add to other data that suggest that antigen tests may provide reasonable sensitivity and specificity and deserve a role to improve testing strategies, especially in resource-limited settings."
144,Symptomatic recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers recovered from COVID-19.,"There is rising concern that patients who recover from COVID-19 may be at risk of recurrence. Increased rates of infection and recurrence in healthcare workers could cause the healthcare system collapse and a further worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we reported the clinically symptomatic recurrent COVID-19 cases in the two healthcare workers who treated and recovered from symptomatic and laboratory confirmed COVID-19. We discuss important questions in the COVID-19 pandemic waiting to be answered, such as the protection period of the acquired immunity, the severity of recurrence and how long after the first infection occurs. We aimed to emphasize that healthcare workers should continue to pay maximum attention to the measures without compromising."
145,Unified platform for genetic and serological detection of COVID-19 with single-molecule technology.,"The COVID-19 pandemic raises the need for diverse diagnostic approaches to rapidly detect different stages of viral infection. The flexible and quantitative nature of single-molecule imaging technology renders it optimal for development of new diagnostic tools. Here we present a proof-of-concept for a single-molecule based, enzyme-free assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The unified platform we developed allows direct detection of the viral genetic material from patients' samples, as well as their immune response consisting of IgG and IgM antibodies. Thus, it establishes a platform for diagnostics of COVID-19, which could also be adjusted to diagnose additional pathogens."
146,Extractionless nucleic acid detection: a high capacity solution to COVID-19 testing.,"We describe an extractionless real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) protocol for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection using heat as an accurate cost-effective high-capacity solution to COVID-19 testing. We present the effect of temperature, transport media, rRT-PCR mastermixes and gene assays on SARS-CoV-2 gene amplification and limits of detection. Utilizing our heated methodology, our limits of detection were 12.5 and 1 genome copy/reaction for singleplex E- and N1-gene assays, respectively, and 1 genome copy/reaction by utilizing an E/N1 or Orf1ab/N1 multiplex assay combination. Using this approach, we detected up to 98% of COVID-19 positive patient samples analyzed in our various cohorts including a significant percentage of weak positives. Importantly, this extractionless approach will allow for >2-fold increase in testing capacity with existing instruments, circumvent the additional need for expensive extraction devices, provide the sensitivity needed for COVID-19 detection and significantly reduce the turn-around time of reporting COVID-19 test results."
147,Optimizing and evaluating PCR-based pooled screening during COVID-19 pandemics.,"Population screening played a substantial role in safely reopening the economy and avoiding new outbreaks of COVID-19. PCR-based pooled screening makes it possible to test the population with limited resources by pooling multiple individual samples. Our study compared different population-wide screening methods as transmission-mitigating interventions, including pooled PCR, individual PCR, and antigen screening. Incorporating testing-isolation process and individual-level viral load trajectories into an epidemic model, we further studied the impacts of testing-isolation on test sensitivities. Results show that the testing-isolation process could maintain a stable test sensitivity during the outbreak by removing most infected individuals, especially during the epidemic decline. Moreover, we compared the efficiency, accuracy, and cost of different screening methods during the pandemic. Our results show that PCR-based pooled screening is cost-effective in reversing the pandemic at low prevalence. When the prevalence is high, PCR-based pooled screening may not stop the outbreak. In contrast, antigen screening with sufficient frequency could reverse the epidemic, despite the high cost and the large numbers of false positives in the screening process."
148,Detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies via rapid diagnostic immunoassays in COVID-19 patients.,"Background: Efficient monitoring and control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) require access to diagnostic tests, and serological diagnostic testing is desirable. In the current study, antibodies were investigated in patients recently diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: Cross-sectional data were obtained from 245 patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection had been confirmed via real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction between March and October 2020. Serum samples were acquired between 2 and 60 days following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms or the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. All specimens were tested simultaneously using an IgM/IgG rapid diagnostic test (RDT), IgG nucleocapsid protein-based chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA), IgG, and IgA spike protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Blood donor samples obtained in 2018 were used as negative controls. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of the RDT IgG were compared with the IgG immunoassays as standards. The RDT IgG exhibited 97.5% sensitivity and 89.4% specificity compared with a CMIA IgG, 98.4% sensitivity, and 78.8% specificity compared with an ELISA IgG. IgM, IgG, and IgA seropositivity rates were low between 1 and 2 weeks after COVID-19 symptom onset or the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. IgM seropositivity rate began decreasing after 4 weeks, whereas IgG and IgA seropositivity rate remained at appreciable levels over the 8-week study period. No cross-reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses was detected. Conclusions: IgG RDT alone or combined with molecular diagnostic tests may be useful for identifying recent SARS-CoV-2 infection."
149,Using artificial intelligence to improve COVID-19 rapid diagnostic test result interpretation.,"Serological rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are widely used across pathologies, often providing users a simple, binary result (positive or negative) in as little as 5 to 20 min. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, new RDTs for identifying SARS-CoV-2 have rapidly proliferated. However, these seemingly easy-to-read tests can be highly subjective, and interpretations of the visible ""bands"" of color that appear (or not) in a test window may vary between users, test models, and brands. We developed and evaluated the accuracy/performance of a smartphone application (xRCovid) that uses machine learning to classify SARS-CoV-2 serological RDT results and reduce reading ambiguities. Across 11 COVID-19 RDT models, the app yielded 99.3% precision compared to reading by eye. Using the app replaces the uncertainty from visual RDT interpretation with a smaller uncertainty of the image classifier, thereby increasing confidence of clinicians and laboratory staff when using RDTs, and creating opportunities for patient self-testing."
150,The increasing importance of the novel Coronavirus.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) instigated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more`` than 20 million people, with more than more than 700000 deaths globally; and has been declared a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as the seventh coronavirus affecting Homo sapiens. The symptoms of COVID-19 consist of an elevated temperature, cough, diarrhea, and vomiting amongst others, whereas the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to arise via release of respiratory secretions; through sneezing and coughing. COVID-19 is identified via X-ray or computed tomography scans and further corroborated with molecular diagnostics techniques, including polymerase chain reaction. At present there are no successful therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2; existing antiviral therapies have been utilized to hinder manifestation of respiratory difficulties by diminishing viral load. Herein, we depict an extensive update on the clinical aspects of COVID-19, including strategies for the regulation of the transmission, diagnosis, treatment, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infections."
151,Portable RT-PCR System: a Rapid and Scalable Diagnostic Tool for COVID-19 Testing.,"Combating the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic demands accurate, rapid, and point-of-care testing with fast results to triage cases for isolation and treatment. The current testing relies on reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), which is routinely performed in well-equipped laboratories by trained professionals at specific locations. However, during busy periods, high numbers of samples queued for testing can delay the test results, impacting efforts to reduce the infection risk. Besides, the absence of well-established laboratories at remote sites and low-resourced environments can contribute to a silent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These reasons compel the need to accommodate point-of-care testing for COVID-19 that meets the ASSURED criteria (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable). This study assessed the agreement and accuracy of the portable Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system against the gold standard tests. Nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were used. Of the 192 samples tested using the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system, the results from 189 samples (98.4%) were in agreement with the reference standard-of-care RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. The portable system generated simultaneous results for nine samples in 80 min with high positive and negative percent agreements of 99.0% and 97.8%, respectively. We performed separate testing in a sealed glove box, offering complete biosafety containment. Thus, the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system can help decentralize COVID-19 testing and offer rapid test results for patients in remote and low-resourced settings."
152,SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a Belgian cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Background: In Belgium, COVID-19 epidemy began on February 4, 2020 with a peak on April 10, 2020. Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) followed in the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc were rapidly isolated before the government lockdown. Methods: After the peak of the epidemy, we measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in 149 patients and collected clinical data. Results: Only 3 asymptomatic patients presented IgG against the virus. In one patient hospitalized for COVID-19 (positive molecular testing), we did not detect any anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as in thirty-five other symptomatic patients considered as possible cases. Conclusions: Even if respiratory symptoms linked to CF are frequent and compatible with COVID-19, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected only in 3 asymptomatic patients. This reassuring study concerning the risk of COVID-19 in patients with CF illustrates the difficulty to distinguish COVID-19 symptoms from respiratory exacerbations and the need of generalized molecular testing to make a precise diagnosis."
153,Will the emergent SARS-CoV2 B.1.1.7 lineage affect molecular diagnosis of COVID-19?,"As the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic keep tackling global public health systems worldwide. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) genome keeps mutating. In that regard, the recent emergence of the B.1.1.7 lineage in the UK has called the attention of global authorities. One point of concern is that if this lineage can be detected by traditional molecular schemes for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Herein, we showed that this lineage does not affect the Berlin-Charité protocol but can challenge the available commercial kits directed to the Spike (S) gene. All efforts should be made to continue to monitor SARS-CoV-2 genomes for potential variants that can impair diagnostic testing and lead to false negative results."
154,Operational characteristics of 30 lateral flow immunoassays used to identify COVID-19 immune response.,"Serology or antibody tests for COVID-19 are designed to detect antibodies (mainly Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) produced in response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) infection. In this study, 30 lateral flow immunoassays were tested using serum or plasma from patients with confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection. Negative serological controls were accessed from a well-characterised bank of sera which were stored prior to February 2020. Operational characteristics and ease of use of the assays are reported. 4/30 (13%) of kits (Zheihang Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG/IgM, Genrui Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) IgG/IgM, Biosynex COVID-19 BSS IgG/IgM, Boson Biotech 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM) were recommended for SAHPRA approval based on kit sensitivity. Of these, only the Orientgene was recommended by SAHPRA in August 2020 for use within the approved national testing algorithm while the remaining three received limited authorization for evaluation. All kits evaluated work on the same basic principle of immunochromatography with minor differences noted in the shape and colour of cartridges, the amount of specimen volume required and the test duration. Performance of the lateral flow tests were similar to sensitivities and specificities reported in other studies. The cassettes of the majority of kits evaluated (90%) detected both IgG and IgM. Only 23% of kits evaluated contained all consumables required for point-of-care testing. The study highlights the need for thorough investigation of kits prior to implementation."
155,Comparison of various serological assays for novel SARS-COV-2.,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study was to compare different immunoassays. We evaluated three immunochromatographic test (The StrongStep®SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM kit, AllTest COV-19 IgG/IgM kit, and Wondfo® SARS-CoV-2 Antibody) and two chemiluminescence immunoassays (CMIA) (Covid-19 VIRCLIA® IgM+IgA/IgG monotest and the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay) in COVID-19 patients. The assays were performed using serum samples of three group patients, i.e., healthy controls, patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive, and patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative clinically diagnosed of COVID-19 infection. The detection percentages of IgG with the StrongStep® SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM kit and AllTest COV-19 IgG/IgM kit were similar in both groups (83.3% and 80.6%, respectively in group 2, p = 0.766) and (42.9% and 50.0%, respectively in group 3, p = 0.706). There were some differences on IgM detection between StrongStep® SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM kit and AllTest COV-19 IgG/IgM kit (11.1% and 30.6%, respectively in group 2, p = 0.042 and 0.0% and 28.6%, respectively in group 3, p = 0.031). The positive rate of IgG in group 2 is higher compared to group 3 with the two immunoassays tested. We observe the same positive rates of IgG with the two CMIA. Our study shows excellent performance of CMIA compared to immunochromatographic test and confirms its potential use in the diagnosis of the new SARS-CoV-2."
156,Early detection of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients in Thailand.,"Background: The presence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is an indicator of protective immunity for most viral infections. A newly developed surrogate viral neutralization assay (sVNT) offers the ability to detect total receptor binding domain-targeting NAbs in an isotype-independent manner, increasing the test sensitivity. Thus, specimens with low IgM/ IgG antibody levels showed strong neutralization activity in sVNT. Methods: This study aimed to measure the %inhibition of NAbs measured by sVNT in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. The sensitivity of sVNT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its kinetics were determined. Results: Ninety-seven patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study. Majority of the patients were 21-40 years old (67%) and 63% had mild symptoms. The sensitivity of sVNT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 99% (95% confidence interval (CI) 94.4-100%) and the specificity was 100% (95% CI 98.3-100%). The negative predictive value of sVNT from the samples collected before and after 7 days of symptom onset was 99.5% (95% CI 97.4-100%) and 100% (95% CI 93.8-100%), respectively. The level of inhibition at days 8-14 were significantly higher than days 0-7 (p<0.001). The median %inhibition values by severity of COVID-19 symptoms were 79.9% (interquartile range (IQR) 49.7-91.8%); 89.0% (IQR 71.2-92.4%); and 86.6% (IQR 69.5-92.8%), for mild, moderate and severe/critical symptoms respectively. The median level of sVNT %inhibition of severe was significantly higher than the mild group (p = 0.05). Conclusion: The sVNT is a practical and robust serological test for SARS-CoV-2 infection and does not require specialized biosafety containment. It can be used clinically to aid diagnosis in both early and late infection especially in cases when the real-time RT-PCR results in weakly negative or weakly positive, and to determine the protective immune response from SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients."
157,"Silent SARS-CoV-2 Infections, Waning Immunity, Serology Testing, and COVID-19 Vaccination: A Perspective.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus causes a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to mild, moderate, or severe illness with multi-organ failure and death. Using a new machine learning algorithm developed by us, we have reported a significantly higher number of predicted COVID-19 cases than the documented counts across the world. The sole reliance on confirmed symptomatic cases overlooking the symptomless COVID-19 infections and the dynamics of waning immunity may not provide 'true' spectrum of infection proportion, a key element for an effective planning and implementation of protection and prevention strategies. We and others have previously shown that strategic orthogonal testing and leveraging systematic data-driven modeling approach to account for asymptomatics and waning cases may situationally have a compelling role in informing efficient vaccination strategies beyond prevalence reporting. However, currently Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend serological testing either before or after vaccination to assess immune status. Given the 27% occurrence of breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated (FV) group with many being asymptomatics and still a larger fraction of the general mass remaining unvaccinated, the relaxed mask mandate and distancing by CDC can drive resurgence. Thus, we believe it is a key time to focus on asymptomatics (no symptoms) and oligosymptomatics (so mild that the symptoms remain unrecognized) as they can be silent reservoirs to propagate the infection. This perspective thus highlights the need for proactive efforts to reevaluate the current variables/strategies in accounting for symptomless and waning fractions."
158,"A rapid, cost-effective tailed amplicon method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2.","Background: The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to an urgent need for scalable methods for clinical diagnostics and viral tracking. Next generation sequencing technologies have enabled large-scale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as thousands of isolates are being sequenced around the world and deposited in public data repositories. A number of methods using both short- and long-read technologies are currently being applied for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, including amplicon approaches, metagenomic methods, and sequence capture or enrichment methods. Given the small genome size, the ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at scale is limited by the cost and labor associated with making sequencing libraries. Results: Here we describe a low-cost, streamlined, all amplicon-based method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2, which bypasses costly and time-consuming library preparation steps. We benchmark this tailed amplicon method against both the ARTIC amplicon protocol and sequence capture approaches and show that an optimized tailed amplicon approach achieves comparable amplicon balance, coverage metrics, and variant calls to the ARTIC v3 approach. Conclusions: The tailed amplicon method we describe represents a cost-effective and highly scalable method for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing."
159,Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19 antigen tests: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to affect countries worldwide. To inhibit the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), testing of patients, contact tracing, and quarantine of their close contacts have been used as major nonpharmaceutical interventions. The advantages of antigen tests, such as low cost and rapid turnaround, may allow for the rapid identification of larger numbers of infectious persons. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Biomed Central databases from inception to January 2, 2021. Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 with reference standards were included. We included studies that provided sufficient data to construct a 2 × 2 table on a per-patient basis. Only articles in English were reviewed. Summary sensitivity and specificity for antigen tests were generated using a random-effects model. Results: Fourteen studies with 8624 participants were included. The meta-analysis for antigen testing generated a pooled sensitivity of 79% (95% CI, 66%-88%; 14 studies, 8624 patients) and a pooled specificity of 100% (95% CI, 99%-100%; 14 studies, 8624 patients). The subgroup analysis of studies that reported specimen collection within 7 days after symptom onset showed a pooled sensitivity of 95% (95% CI, 78%-99%; four studies, 1342 patients) and pooled specificity of 100% (95% CI, 97%-100%; four studies, 1342 patients). Regarding the applicability, the patient selection, index tests, and reference standards of studies in our meta-analysis matched the review title. Conclusion: Antigen tests have moderate sensitivity and high specificity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Antigen tests might have a higher sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days after symptom onset. Based on our findings, antigen testing might be an effective method for identifying contagious individuals to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission."
160,Clinical and laboratory characteristics of symptomatic healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19: a prospective cohort study.,"A comprehensive clinical and microbiological assessments of COVID-19 in front-line healthcare workers (HCWs) is needed. Between April 10th and May 28th, 2020, 319 HCWs with acute illness were reviewed. In addition to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR screening, a multiplex molecular panel was used for testing other respiratory pathogens. For SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs, the normalized viral load, viral culture, and virus neutralization assays were performed weekly. For SARS-CoV-2 negative HCWs, SARS-CoV-2 serological testing was performed one month after inclusion. Among the 319 HCWs included, 67 (21.0%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 65/67 (97.0%) developed mild form of COVID-19. Other respiratory pathogens were found in 6/66 (9.1%) SARS-CoV-2 positive and 47/241 (19.5%) SARS-Cov-2 negative HCWs (p = 0.07). The proportion of HCWs with a viral load > 5.0 log10 cp/mL (Ct value < 25) was less than 15% at 8 days after symptom onset; 12% of HCWs were positive after 40 days (Ct > 37). More than 90% of cultivable virus had a viral load > 4.5 log10 cp/mL (Ct < 26) and were collected within 10 days after symptom onset. Among negative HCWs, 6/190 (3.2%) seroconverted. Our data suggest that the determination of viral load can be used for appreciating the infectiousness of infected HCWs. These data could be helpful for facilitating their return to work."
161,"Isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification-lateral flow detection of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19.","The rapid detection of novel pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 necessitates the development of easy-to-use diagnostic tests that can be readily adapted and utilized in both clinical laboratories and field settings. Delay in diagnosis has facilitated the rapid spread of this novel virus throughout the world resulting in global mortality that will surpass 2.5 million people. Development of point-of-care diagnostic assays that can be performed in rural or decentralized health care centers to expand testing capacity is needed. We developed a qualitative test based on recombinase-polymerase-amplification coupled with lateral flow reading (RPA-LF) for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. The RPA-LF detected SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 35.4 viral cDNA nucleocapsid (N) gene copies/μL. Additionally, the RPA-LF was able to detect 0.25-2.5 copies/μL of SARS-CoV-2 N gene containing plasmid. We evaluated 37 nasopharyngeal samples using CDC's N3, N1 and N2 RT-real-time PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 as reference test. We found a 100 % concordance between RPA-LF and RT-qPCR reference test as determined by 18/18 positive and 19/19 negative samples. All positive samples had Ct values between 19-37 by RT-qPCR. The RPA-LF primers and probe did not cross react with other relevant betacoronaviruses such as SARS and MERS. This is the first isothermal amplification test paired with lateral flow developed for qualitative detection of COVID-19 allowing rapid viral detection and with prospective applicability in resource limited and decentralized laboratories."
162,Diagnostic performance and clinical implications of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing in Mexico using real-world nationwide COVID-19 registry data.,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity is important to monitor epidemic dynamics and as a mitigation strategy. Given difficulties of large-scale quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) implementation, rapid antigen tests (Rapid Ag-T) have been proposed as alternatives in settings like Mexico. Here, we evaluated diagnostic performance of Rapid Ag-T for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated clinical implications compared to qRT-PCR testing in Mexico. Methods: We analyzed data from the COVID-19 registry of the Mexican General Directorate of Epidemiology up to April 30th, 2021 (n = 6,632,938) and cases with both qRT-PCR and Rapid Ag-T (n = 216,388). We evaluated diagnostic performance using accuracy measures and assessed time-dependent changes in the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC). We also explored test discordances as predictors of hospitalization, intubation, severe COVID-19 and mortality. Results: Rapid Ag-T is primarily used in Mexico City. Rapid Ag-T have low sensitivity 37.6% (95%CI 36.6-38.7), high specificity 95.5% (95%CI 95.1-95.8) and acceptable positive 86.1% (95%CI 85.0-86.6) and negative predictive values 67.2% (95%CI 66.2-69.2). Rapid Ag-T has optimal diagnostic performance up to days 3 after symptom onset, and its performance is modified by testing location, comorbidity, and age. qRT-PCR (-) / Rapid Ag-T (+) cases had higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes (HR 1.54 95% CI 1.41-1.68) and were older, qRT-PCR (+)/ Rapid Ag-T(-) cases had slightly higher risk or adverse outcomes and ≥7 days from symptom onset (HR 1.53 95% CI 1.48-1.59). Cases detected with rapid Ag-T were younger, without comorbidities, and milder COVID-19 course. Conclusions: Rapid Ag-T could be used as an alternative to qRT-PCR for large scale SARS-CoV-2 testing in Mexico. Interpretation of Rapid Ag-T results should be done with caution to minimize the risk associated with false negative results."
163,On-admission SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia as a single potent predictive marker of critical condition development and mortality in COVID-19.,"Background: This study aimed to clarify how SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is related to COVID-19 critical condition development and mortality in comparison with other predictive markers and scoring systems. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at Yokohama Municipal Citizen's Hospital and National Institute of Infectious Diseases. We recruited adult patients with COVID-19 admitted between March 2020 and January 2021. We compared RNAemia with clinical status on admission including scoring systems such as the 4C Mortality, CURB-65, and A-DROP, as well as the Ct value of the nasopharyngeal PCR, in predicting COVID-19 mortality and critical condition development. Results: Of the 92 recruited patients (median age, 58; interquartile range, 45-71 years), 14 (14.9%) had RNAemia. These patients had an older age (median, 68 years vs. 55.5 years; p = 0.011), higher values of lactated dehydrogenase (median, 381 U/L vs. 256.5 U/L, p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (median, 10.9 mg/dL vs. 3.8 mg/dL; p < 0.001), D-dimer (median, 2.07 μg/mL vs. 1.28 μg/mL; p = 0.015), lower values of lymphocyte (median, 802/μL vs. 1007/μL, p = 0.025) and Ct of the nasopharyngeal PCR assay (median, 20.59 vs. 25.54; p = 0.021) than those without RNAemia. Univariate analysis showed RNAemia was associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR], 18.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.92-89.76; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.7851; p = 0.002) and critical condition (OR, 72.00; 95% CI, 12.98-399.29; AUC, 0.8198; p < 0.001). Plus, multivariate analysis also revealed the association of RNAemia with critical condition (adjusted OR, 125.71; 95% CI, 11.47-1377.32; p < 0.001). Conclusion: On-admission SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is a potent predictive marker of COVID-19 critical condition and mortality. The adjusted OR for critical condition was as high as 125.71."
164,"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 using qRT-PCR in saliva obtained from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients, comparative analysis with matched nasopharyngeal samples.","Objectives: The accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared the quantitative RT-PCR results between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva specimens. Methods: A COVID-19 outbreak occurred on a cruise ship at Nagasaki port, Japan. We obtained 123 nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva each from asymptomatic or mild patients in the late phase of infection. Results: The intervals from the diagnosis to the sampling were 25.5 days for nasopharyngeal swabs and 28.9 days for saliva. The positive rate was 19.5% (24/123) for nasopharyngeal swabs and 38.2% (47/123) for saliva (P = 0.48). The quantified viral copies (mean ± SEM copies/5 μl) were 9.3±2.6 in nasopharyngeal swabs and 920±850 in saliva (P = 0.0006). Conclusions: The advantages of saliva specimens include positive rate improvement and accurate viral load detection. Saliva may be used as a reliable sample for SARS-CoV-2 detection."
165,Digital PCR assay for the effective detection of COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 low viral load.,"Objective: Viral nucleic acid detection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the current standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to low viral load in some COVID-19 patients, false negative results from this method have been repeatedly reported. Method: In this study, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of digital PCR (dPCR) in simulated samples and clinical samples with qPCR assay through a series of vigorous tests. Results: The results showed that dPCR was more sensitive than qPCR especially for samples with low viral load (≤3 copies). In addition, dPCR had similar specificity as qPCR and could effectively distinguish other human coronaviruses and influenza virus from SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, dPCR was more sensitive than qPCR in detecting the virus in the ""negative"" samples from recurrent COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: In summary, dPCR could serve as a powerful complement to the current qPCR method for SARS-CoV-2 detection, especially for the samples with extremely low viral load, such as recurrent COVID-19 patients."
166,Evaluation of the Abbott Panbio(TM) COVID-19 Ag rapid antigen test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic Canadians.,"Several rapid testing methodologies have been approved for testing of symptomatic individuals but have not been validated for asymptomatic screening. We evaluated performance of the Abbott PanbioTM COVID-19 rapid antigen assay in the asymptomatic setting. We conducted a prospective study in an urban assessment center and in the context of long-term care staff screening. A total of 3014 individuals submitted paired nasopharyngeal samples, which were tested in parallel with the rapid antigen and laboratory-based, RT-PCR assays SARS-CoV-2 detection. There was 54.5% concordance in positive results between the rapid antigen assay and RT-PCR. All positive rapid antigen assay results were confirmed by RT-PCR. The negative predictive value of the rapid antigen assay minimally improved on the negative pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Abbott PanbioTM COVID-19 rapid antigen test allowed for faster identification of infected individuals but cannot be used to rule-out SARS-CoV-2 infection."
167,High blood pressure in the young: why should we care?,"While primary hypertension (HTN) clearly occurs in children and adolescents, the approach of many providers to such patients can best be described as ambivalent: the condition may be recognised, but is not acted upon. Such ambivalence may stem from incomplete understanding of the effects of high blood pressure in the young, which in turn is related to the shortage of information on long-term outcomes of primary childhood HTN. However, other evidence on the short- and long-term effects of blood pressure elevation in childhood clearly shows that it is not a benign condition at all. Conclusion: Childhood HTN warrants action to prevent adult cardiovascular disease."
168,"Seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.","The National High Blood Pressure Education Program presents the complete Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Like its predecessors, the purpose is to provide an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of hypertension. The key messages of this report are these: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (BP) of greater than 140 mm Hg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (systolic BP 120-139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80-89 mm Hg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions that are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg) for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease; for patients whose BP is more than 20 mm Hg above the systolic BP goal or more than 10 mm Hg above the diastolic BP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will be controlled only if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan. Positive experiences, trust in the clinician, and empathy improve patient motivation and satisfaction. This report serves as a guide, and the committee continues to recognize that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount."
169,The Malaria-High Blood Pressure Hypothesis: Revisited.,"Malaria etiologies with pathophysiological similarities to hypertension currently constitute a major subject of research. The malaria-high blood pressure hypothesis is strongly supported by observations of the increasing incidence of hypertension in malaria-endemic, low- and middle-income countries with poor socioeconomic conditions, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries. Malnutrition and low birth weight with persistent symptomatic malaria presentations in pregnancy correlate strongly with the development of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and subsequent hypertension in adult life. Evidence suggest that the link between malaria infection and high blood pressure involves interactions between malaria parasites and erythrocytes, the inflammatory process, effects of the infection during pregnancy; effects on renal and vascular functions as well as effects in sickle cell disease. Possible mechanisms which provide justification for the malaria-high blood pressure hypothesis include the following: endothelial dysfunction (reduced nitric oxide (NO) levels), impaired release of local neurotransmitters and cytokines, decrease in vascular smooth muscle cell viability and/or alterations in cellular calcium signaling leading to enhanced vascular reactivity, remodeling, and cardiomyopathies, deranged homeostasis through dehydration, elevated intracellular mediators and proinflammatory cytokine responses, possible genetic regulations, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system mechanisms and renal derangements, severe anemia and hemolysis, renal failure, and end organ damage. Two key mediators of the malaria-high blood pressure association are: endothelial dysfunction (reduced NO) and increased angiotensin-converting enzyme activity/angiotensin II levels. Sickle cell disease is associated with protection against malaria infection and reduced blood pressure. In this review, we present the state of knowledge about the malaria-blood pressure hypothesis and suggest insights for future studies."
170,Screening for high blood pressure in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement.,Description: Update of the 2007 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reaffirmation recommendation statement on screening for high blood pressure in adults. Methods: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of different methods for confirming a diagnosis of hypertension after initial screening and the optimal rescreening interval for diagnosing hypertension. Population: This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older without known hypertension. Recommendation: The USPSTF recommends screening for high blood pressure in adults aged 18 years or older. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends obtaining measurements outside of the clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation before starting treatment.
171,Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the hypertensive crisis.,"High blood pressure is a problem with elevated prevalence in the world population. The acute forms of presentation are ""hypertensive crises,"" which represent a frequent cause for emergency room and primary care consultations. Hypertensive crises are divided into hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies, depending on whether or not there is acute damage to the target organ, respectively. Each situation has a different prognosis and treatment. More specifically, hypertensive emergencies are potentially serious and usually require rapid reductions in blood pressure, whereas hypertensive urgencies can be treated as outpatients by reducing blood pressure in hours or days. A significant number of patients who consult medical professionals regarding a hypertensive crisis do not have a prior diagnosis of hypertension; therefore, it is important to periodically monitor blood pressure levels in the community."
172,Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in the 21st century.,"In clinical practice, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) tends to be used solely for diagnosing hypertension, especially to identify white-coat and masked hypertension. However, ABPM can provide additional information to guide the management and drug treatment of hypertension. In this brief review, the general principles governing the use of ABPM in clinical practice, such as the devices and software, recording requirements, the thresholds for the day, night and 24-hour periods and how often to repeat ABPM are summarized. The use of ABPM for diagnosing, determining the efficacy of treatment, and assessing the long-term control of hypertension are discussed."
173,"Insomnia, Short Sleep Duration, and High Blood Pressure: Recent Evidence and Future Directions for the Prevention and Management of Hypertension.","Purpose of review: To summarize research from the past 2 years on the association between insomnia, short sleep duration, and hypertension and provide a critical analysis of the evidence and suggestions for future directions in this field. Recent findings: Evidence indicates that the association between insomnia and elevated blood pressure (BP) or stage 1 and 2 hypertension is stronger in those with chronic insomnia, as compared to those with isolated insomnia symptoms, and primarily found in those with the insomnia with objective short sleep duration phenotype. There is a key gap in ambulatory BP monitoring across the sleep-wake cycle as well as in randomized clinical trials testing the effectiveness of pharmacological or cognitive-behavioral insomnia therapies in lowering BP. Insomnia is a strong candidate to join the list of risk factors for hypertension along with obstructive sleep apnea. In the meantime, chronic insomnia should become part of the routine assessment of patients with elevated BP and should be a source for referral, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment, rather than regarded as a symptom of the underlying medical disorder."
174,Report of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy.,"This report updates the 1990 ""National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group Report on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy"" and focuses on classification, pathophysiologic features, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Through a combination of evidence-based medicine and consensus this report updates contemporary approaches to hypertension control during pregnancy by expanding on recommendations made in ""The Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure."" The recommendations to use Korotkoff phase V for determination of diastolic pressure and to eliminate edema as a criterion for diagnosing preeclampsia are discussed. In addition, the use as a diagnostic criterion of blood pressure increases of 30 mm Hg systolic or 15 mm Hg diastolic with blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg has not been recommended, because available evidence shows that women with blood pressures fitting this description are not more likely to have adverse outcomes. Management distinctions are made between chronic hypertension that is present before pregnancy and hypertension that occurs as part of the pregnancy-specific condition of preeclampsia, as well as management considerations for women with comorbid conditions. A discussion of the pharmacologic treatment of hypertension during pregnancy includes recommendations for specific agents. The use of low-dose aspirin, calcium, or other dietary supplements in the prevention of preeclampsia is described, and expanded sections on counseling women for future pregnancies and recommendations for future research are included."
175,Prevalence of high blood pressure under 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To understand the prevalence of high blood pressure among the general adult population under the new diagnostic criteria. PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched. Two investigators independently performed data extraction and quality assessment, and the disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third investigator. The random-effects model was performed to pool the prevalence of high blood pressure among the population. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to explore the source of heterogeneity. The study protocol has been registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019147330. In total, 52 articles included in the meta-analysis with a total of 54 studies. An obvious increase in the prevalence of high blood pressure was identified by the application of new diagnostic criteria. The pooled prevalence of high blood pressure among the population was 53.01% (95% confidence interval 51.13-54.88%). Subgroup analysis showed that the WHO region, national, and age could significantly influence the prevalence of hypertension (P < 0.01). Meta-regression analyses revealed that study quality and sex ratio (male, %) did not contribute to the heterogeneity of the results (P > 0.05). The sensitivity analysis showed that the results were stable. With the use of new diagnostic criteria, the prevalence of high blood pressure has shown an upward trend, especially in Europe countries. Prevention and control measures should focus more on improving cardiovascular and cerebrovascular status in Europe countries. Standard electronic blood pressure monitors were recommended for use in future studies, and at least two more readings should be taken during a visit."
176,Practice Recommendations for Diagnosis and Treatment of the Most Common Forms of Secondary Hypertension.,"The vast majority of hypertensive patients are never sought for a cause of their high blood pressure, i.e. for a 'secondary' form of arterial hypertension. This under detection explains why only a tiny percentage of hypertensive patients are ultimately diagnosed with a secondary form of arterial hypertension. The prevalence of these forms is, therefore, markedly underestimated, although, they can involve as many as one-third of the cases among referred patients and up to half of those with difficult to treat hypertension. The early detection of a secondary form is crucial, because if diagnosed in a timely manner, these forms can be cured at long-term, and even when cure cannot be achieved, their diagnosis provides a better control of high blood pressure, and allows prevention of hypertension-mediated organ damage, and related cardiovascular complications. Enormous progress has been made in the understanding, diagnostic work-up, and management of secondary hypertension in the last decades. The aim of this minireview is, therefore, to provide updated concise information on the screening, diagnosis, and management of the most common forms, including primary aldosteronism, renovascular hypertension, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, Cushing's syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea."
177,Hypertension in the elderly.,"Data collected over a 30-year period have demonstrated the increasing prevalence of hypertension with age. Aging is an inevitable part of life and brings along two inconvenient events: physiologic decline and disease state. High blood pressure (HBP) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in the elderly. It is a significant and often asymptomatic chronic disease, which requires optimal control and persistent adherence to prescribed medication to reduce the risks of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal disease. Hypertension in the elderly patients represents a management dilemma to geriatric and cardiovascular specialists and other practitioners. Furthermore, with the wide adoption of multiple drug strategies targeting subgroups of hypertensive patients with specific risk conditions to lower blood pressure (BP), difficult questions arise about how aggressive treatment of elderly patients should be. The purpose of the following chapter article is to review the pathophysiology of aging as well as the epidemiology and the clinical assessment of high blood pressure (HBP) in older people."
178,Primary prevention of hypertension: clinical and public health advisory from The National High Blood Pressure Education Program.,"The National High Blood Pressure Education Program Coordinating Committee published its first statement on the primary prevention of hypertension in 1993. This article updates the 1993 report, using new and further evidence from the scientific literature. Current recommendations for primary prevention of hypertension involve a population-based approach and an intensive targeted strategy focused on individuals at high risk for hypertension. These 2 strategies are complementary and emphasize 6 approaches with proven efficacy for prevention of hypertension: engage in moderate physical activity; maintain normal body weight; limit alcohol consumption; reduce sodium intake; maintain adequate intake of potassium; and consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and reduced in saturated and total fat. Applying these approaches to the general population as a component of public health and clinical practice can help prevent blood pressure from increasing and can help decrease elevated blood pressure levels for those with high normal blood pressure or hypertension."
179,High blood pressure in children and adolescents.,"High blood pressure in children and adolescents is a growing health problem that is often overlooked by physicians. Normal blood pressure values for children and adolescents are based on age, sex, and height, and are available in standardized tables. Prehypertension is defined as a blood pressure in at least the 90th percentile, but less than the 95th percentile, for age, sex, and height, or a measurement of 120/80 mm Hg or greater. Hypertension is defined as blood pressure in the 95th percentile or greater. A secondary etiology of hypertension is much more likely in children than in adults, with renal parenchymal disease and renovascular disease being the most common. Overweight and obesity are strongly correlated with primary hypertension in children. A history and physical examination are needed for all children with newly diagnosed hypertension to help rule out underlying medical disorders. Children with hypertension should also be screened for other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, and should be evaluated for target organ damage with a retinal examination and echocardiography. Hypertension in children is treated with lifestyle changes, including weight loss for those who are overweight or obese; a healthy, low-sodium diet; regular physical activity; and avoidance of tobacco and alcohol. Children with symptomatic hypertension, secondary hypertension, target organ damage, diabetes, or persistent hypertension despite nonpharmacologic measures should be treated with antihypertensive medications. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers are safe, effective, and well tolerated in children."
180,Pediatric Hypertension.,"The prevalence of elevated blood pressure and hypertension in children and adolescents has increased over the past decade. This trend is most likely related to increases in primary hypertension associated with increasing obesity rates in children. Lifestyle as well as genetics play a significant role in the development of primary hypertension. Hypertension in children and adolescents is under-recognized and undertreated. The 2017 Revised Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents aimed to create new normative blood pressure tables using data from healthy weight children, meaning between the 5th and 85th percentile per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another important objective was to simplify normative data to ease screening and detection of elevated blood pressures. The consequences of chronic hypertension are significant, with its major affect being in poor cardiovascular health outcomes both in childhood and early adulthood. Challenges to detection and adequate treatment should be overcome with continued education and awareness to prevent the long-term effects of uncontrolled hypertension that starts in childhood. [Pediatr Ann. 2018;47(12):e499-e503.]."
181,High blood pressure in the young.,"Essential hypertension begins in early childhood. Current evidence suggests that those children persisting at high levels over time may be considered to have essential hypertension. The evaluation of high levels is best judged from blood pressure percentile grids representing population measurements, as long as the methods used to measure blood pressure and to generate the grids are similar. Resting, basal blood pressure measurements are more reproducible and are better for following the time course of blood pressure levels in children. Measurements should be made in an unhurried, relaxed atmosphere by trained observers using adequately lighted instruments placed at eye level and a cuff size appropriate for the child's arm length and circumference. Repeated observations and serial blood pressure measurements of growing children are necessary for judgments of abnormal levels. There is a progressive rise of approximately 1.5 mm Hg systolic and 1 mm Hg diastolic pressure per year of age, but blood pressure levels in the growing child are more closely related to height. In most instances elevated blood pressure levels in children cannot be attributed to secondary causes. Various hemodynamic and biochemical mechanisms have been identified in the early stages of hypertension, and mechanisms contributing to the development of hypertension may be of different magnitudes in black children and white children. Studies following young adults over many years have shown the predictive value of baseline blood pressure levels for subsequent hypertension. Children tracking at the high percentiles can be identified and are candidates for early intervention. The key to early prevention of essential hypertension is to influence children and adolescents to adopt lifestyles that promote good health and prevent development of cardiovascular risk factors."
182,"The sixth report of the Joint National Committee on prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure.","Racial and ethnic minority populations are growing segments of our society. The prevalence of hypertension in these populations differs across groups, and control rates are not as good as in the general population. Clinicians should be aware of these management challenges, taking social and cultural factors into account. Guidelines are provided for management of children and women with hypertension. In older persons, diuretics are preferred and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists may be considered. Specific therapy for patients with LVH, coronary artery disease, and heart failure are outlined. Patients with renal insufficiency with greater than 1 g/d of proteinuria should be treated to a therapy blood pressure goal of 125/75 mm Hg; those with less proteinuria should be treated to a blood pressure goal of 130/85 mm Hg. ACE inhibitors have additional renoprotective effects over other antihypertensive agents. Patients with diabetes should be treated to a therapy blood pressure goal of below 130/85 mm Hg. Hypertension may coexist with various other conditions and may be induced by various pressor agents."
183,Blood pressure and high blood pressure. Aspects of risk.,"This report deals with three aspects of risk related to blood pressure and high blood pressure. The first aspect of risk concerns distributions of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the adult population and their relation to long-term risk of morbidity and mortality. By middle age, only a minority (about 20%) of Americans have optimal SBP and DBP levels, less than 120 mm Hg and less than 80 mm Hg, respectively. For the majority with higher levels, risks of major clinical events, including death from cardiovascular diseases and from all causes, are markedly increased. The relations of SBP and DBP with risk are strong, continuous, and graded. Risk is sizable not only for persons with high blood pressure by usual clinical criteria (SBP greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or DBP greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg), but also for those with ""high-normal"" blood pressure (e.g., SBP 130-139 mm Hg or DBP 80-89 mm Hg). Thus, the blood pressure problem is a population-wide one and requires for its control a combined population-wide and high-risk strategy. A major component of this strategy must be nutritional-hygienic measures for the primary prevention of the rise in blood pressure during adulthood and of high blood pressure (i.e., primary prevention not only of the complications of high blood pressure but also of high blood pressure itself) through improved lifestyles having the potential to shift downward the blood pressure distribution of the whole population. The second aspect of risk concerns the known risk factors (i.e., aspects of modern lifestyle) leading to the mass occurrence of blood pressure rise during adulthood and of high blood pressure. These risk factors are high salt intake, high dietary sodium/potassium ratio, calorie imbalance and resultant obesity, and high alcohol intake. The extensive data base establishing the role of these common traits in the etiology of the blood pressure/high blood pressure problem is the scientific foundation for efforts to achieve the primary prevention of high blood pressure. The third aspect of risk relates to the combined impact of other risk factors along with blood pressure-high blood pressure in markedly increasing the probabilities of morbidity and mortality (e.g., ""rich"" diet, diet-dependent serum cholesterol and uric acid, smoking, diabetes, and target-organ damage). Prevention and control of lifestyle-related traits are essential components of the strategy for dealing with the blood pressure-high blood pressure problem."
184,High blood pressure: the foundation for epidemic cardiovascular disease in African populations.,"High-blood pressure is a powerful independent risk factor for death from heart disease and stroke. It is also a common clinical condition affecting more than 600 million persons worldwide and seen in nearly all populations. Although reliable, large-scale, population-based data on high blood pressure in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are limited, recent studies provide important and worrisome findings in both epidemiology and clinical outcomes. Although overall hypertension prevalence is between 10%-15%, prevalence rates as high as 30%-32% have been reported in middle-income urban and some rural areas. Importantly, hypertension awareness, treatment, and control rates as low as 20%, 10%, and 1%, respectively have also been found. Stroke has been by far the most common clinical sequela. In most SSA settings, hypertension control assumes a relatively low priority and little experience exists in implementing sustainable and successful programs for drug treatment. Rapid urbanization and transition from agrarian life to the wage-earning economy of city life continue to fuel increases in average blood pressure levels and prevalence of hypertension. Although the true burden of high blood pressure in sub-Saharan Africa remains largely unmeasured, compelling preliminary evidence suggests that it is the foundation for epidemic cardiovascular disease in Africa and already contributes substantively to death and disability from stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure in this region. Success in limiting this epidemic in SSA will depend heavily on the implementation of sustainable and aggressive population-based programs for high blood pressure awareness, prevention, treatment, and control. It will be critical to obtain investments in improved surveillance and program-relevant research to provide the evidence base for policy development and effective hypertension prevention and control."
185,The elusiveness of population-wide high blood pressure control.,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It is highly prevalent in the US general population, especially in those who are old, African American, or socially disadvantaged. Prevalence is also high and increasing worldwide. Awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension have improved over time, but there is still considerable room for improvement. The optimal solution to this health challenge varies by country. Several nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions are well proven as effective means to prevent hypertension and improve control rates in those with established hypertension. Better prevention and control of hypertension will yield substantial general population health benefits and remain high priorities in public health."
186,Risk of high blood pressure associated with objective insomnia and self-reported insomnia complaints in major depression: A study on 703 individuals.,"Background: Since few studies have investigated the risk of high blood pressure associated with objective insomnia and self-reported insomnia complaints in major depression, the aim of this study was to examine this risk in a large sample of individuals with major depression. Methods: Data from 703 individuals with major depression recruited from the research database of the sleep laboratory of the Erasme Hospital were analysed. High blood pressure status was defined by the presence of one of the following: self-reports at interview of either a physician-diagnosis or taking antihypertensive medication; or an average systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or an average diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg during at least two medical examinations. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the risk of high blood pressure associated with objective insomnia and self-reported insomnia complaints in major depression. Results: After adjustment for major confounding factors associated with high blood pressure, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that severe objective insomnia, low complaints of repeated nighttime awakenings or early morning awakening, and intermediate or low self-reported insomnia complaints were significant risk factors of high blood pressure in major depression. Conclusion: In major depression, severe objective insomnia and lower self-reported insomnia complaints are associated with higher risk of high blood pressure, which justifies a better management of objective insomnia and a better assessment of insomnia complaints in this particular subpopulation to avoid the negative consequences related to the co-occurrence of high blood pressure and major depression.

187,"Global burden of blood-pressure-related disease, 2001.","Background: Few studies have assessed the extent and distribution of the blood-pressure burden worldwide. The aim of this study was to quantify the global burden of disease related to high blood pressure. Methods: Worldwide burden of disease attributable to high blood pressure (> or =115 mm Hg systolic) was estimated for groups according to age (> or =30 years), sex, and World Bank region in the year 2001. Population impact fractions were calculated with data for mean systolic blood pressure, burden of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and relative risk corrected for regression dilution bias. Findings: Worldwide, 7.6 million premature deaths (about 13.5% of the global total) and 92 million DALYs (6.0% of the global total) were attributed to high blood pressure. About 54% of stroke and 47% of ischaemic heart disease worldwide were attributable to high blood pressure. About half this burden was in people with hypertension; the remainder was in those with lesser degrees of high blood pressure. Overall, about 80% of the attributable burden occurred in low-income and middle-income economies, and over half occurred in people aged 45-69 years. Interpretation: Most of the disease burden caused by high blood pressure is borne by low-income and middle-income countries, by people in middle age, and by people with prehypertension. Prevention and treatment strategies restricted to individuals with hypertension will miss much blood-pressure-related disease."
188,High blood pressure in Latin America: a call to action.,"High blood pressure (BP) is an enormous global problem, and is especially challenging for low- and middle-income countries such as those of Latin America. Although developed countries have benefited from significant reductions in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in recent decades, comparable reductions have not been achieved in Latin America. In fact, the prevalence of high BP is increasing in many Latin American countries, and the situation will worsen without definitive efforts to correct it. The growing preponderance of hypertension and chronic diseases, coupled with expected increases in population growth, present a mounting threat to Latin American economies. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the burden of high BP throughout Latin America, and presents recommendations for change. The dismal observations warrant a call to action for improved control of high BP and other cardiovascular risk factors across Latin America. Achieving these ambitious goals will require collaborative efforts by many groups, including policymakers, international organizations, healthcare providers, schools and society as a whole."
189,Management of high blood pressure in Blacks: an update of the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement.,"Since the first International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on the ""Management of High Blood Pressure in African American"" in 2003, data from additional clinical trials have become available. We reviewed hypertension and cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment guidelines, pharmacological hypertension clinical end point trials, and blood pressure-lowering trials in blacks. Selected trials without significant black representation were considered. In this update, blacks with hypertension are divided into 2 risk strata, primary prevention, where elevated blood pressure without target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, or overt cardiovascular disease for whom blood pressure consistently <135/85 mm Hg is recommended, and secondary prevention, where elevated blood pressure with target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, and/or a history of cardiovascular disease, for whom blood pressure consistently <130/80 mm Hg is recommended. If blood pressure is ≤10 mm Hg above target levels, monotherapy with a diuretic or calcium channel blocker is preferred. When blood pressure is >15/10 mm Hg above target, 2-drug therapy is recommended, with either a calcium channel blocker plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker or, alternatively, in edematous and/or volume-overload states, with a thiazide diuretic plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker. Effective multidrug therapeutic combinations through 4 drugs are described. Comprehensive lifestyle modifications should be initiated in blacks when blood pressure is ≥115/75 mm Hg. The updated International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on hypertension management in blacks lowers the minimum target blood pressure level for the lowest-risk blacks, emphasizes effective multidrug regimens, and de-emphasizes monotherapy."
190,Importance of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in the diagnosis and prognosis of pediatric hypertension.,"The prevalence of high blood pressure (BP) at pediatric age has increased progressively, one of the causes of which is obesity. However, the dominant etiology in this age group is renal and/or cardiovascular pathology. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is the method of choice for the diagnosis of hypertension, especially in children at high cardiovascular risk. Its use is limited to children from five years of age. Choosing appropriate cuff size is key to obtaining correct blood pressure. The main indication for ABPM is to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. It also allows the diagnosis of white coat hypertension (which may represent an intermediate stage between the normotensive phase and hypertension), or masked hypertension, associated with progression to sustained hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Children with isolated nocturnal hypertension should be considered as having masked hypertension. BP load is defined as the percentage of valid measurements above the 95th percentile for age, gender, and height. Values above 25-30% are pathological and those above 50% are predictive of LVH. ABPM correlates with target organ damage, particularly LVH and renal damage. It is useful in the differentiation of secondary hypertension, since these children show higher BP load and less nocturnal dipping, and confirmation of response to therapy. Thus ABPM allows the diagnosis and classification of hypertension, provides cardiovascular prognostic information and identifies patients with intermediate phenotypes of hypertension."
191,High blood pressure treatment in the elderly.,"Clinicians should clearly understand the magnitude of the clinical benefits attributable to the treatment of hypertension in the elderly so that appropriate tradeoffs can be made between benefits and side effects. Potential types of overtreatment of elevated blood pressure in older persons include inaccurate measurement technique, insufficient numbers of readings, and too great a lowering of blood pressure."
192,High Blood Pressure in Adolescents of Curitiba: Prevalence and Associated Factors.,"Background: Arterial hypertension is a major public health problem and has increased considerably in young individuals in past years. Thus, identifying factors associated with this condition is important to guide intervention strategies in this population. Objective: To determine high blood pressure prevalence and its associated factors in adolescents. Methods: A random sample of 1,242 students enrolled in public schools of the city of Curitiba (PR) was selected. Self-administered questionnaires provided family history of hypertension, daily energy expenditure, smoking habit, daily fat intake, and socioeconomic status. Waist circumference was measured following standardized procedures, and blood pressure was measured with appropriate cuffs in 2 consecutive days to confirm high blood pressure. Relative frequency and confidence interval (95%CI) indicated high blood pressure prevalence. Bivariate and multivariate analyses assessed the association of risk factors with high blood pressure. Results: The high blood pressure prevalence was 18.2% (95%CI 15.2-21.6). Individuals whose both parents had hypertension [odds ratio (OR), 2.22; 95%CI 1.28-3.85] and those with high waist circumference (OR, 2.1; 95%CI 1.34-3.28) had higher chances to develop high blood pressure. Conclusion: Positive family history of hypertension and high waist circumference were associated with high blood pressure in adolescents. These factors are important to guide future interventions in this population."
193,[Diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure: internationals standards and divergences].,"Diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure: internationals standards and divergences. High blood pressure affects more than 1.4 billion people worldwide and this number is increasing. Three international recommendations were published between 2017 and 2018. Essential hypertension is defined differently from one recommendation to another; AHA/ACC recommendations retain 130/80 mmHg, compared to 140/90 mmHg for Canada and Europe, resulting in a higher prevalence of hypertension. The management of hypertensive patients is based on 2 axes: a non-pharmacological axis that must be recalled at each consultation, and a pharmacological axis; for which the American and European guidelines recommend the introduction of a dual therapy, pharmacologically complementary, when initiating treatment in hypertensive patients. Blood pressure targets are lower in the United States than in Canada and Europe."
194,Effect of Comprehensive Interventions Including Nutrition Education and Physical Activity on High Blood Pressure among Children: Evidence from School-Based Cluster Randomized Control Trial in China.,"Childhood hypertension has increasingly become a public health problem globally. However, limited literature research examined the effect of comprehensive interventions including nutrition education and physical activity on blood pressure among children. A total of 6764 children aged 7-13 years were analyzed based on a multicenter randomized controlled trial for comprehensive interventions in 30 primary schools in China to evaluate the effects on blood pressure, which lasted for two semesters. The standards used for the diagnosis of high blood pressure were the cut-off points based on age and sex for Chinese children. Compared with the control group, the intervention effects were -0.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.1, 0; p = 0.064) for diastolic blood pressure and -0.9 mmHg (95% CI: -1.5, -0.3; p = 0.005) for systolic blood pressure. For the incidence of high blood pressure, the changes were -1.4% in the intervention group and 0.4% in the control group (1.8% difference between the two groups, p = 0.015) after trial. The school-based comprehensive interventions appeared to have moderate effects on high blood pressure prevention among children in China."
195,High blood pressure: An obscuring misnomer?,"High blood pressure (BP) has been identified as a major risk factor for cardiovascular complications. Although two-way association between BP and hypertensive complications makes hypertension a near-ideal biomarker, BP as ""the cause"" for the complications of HT per se still needs more evidence. Another entirely possible hemodynamic candidate for causing hypertensive cardiovascular adverse events can be flow or its iterations, which might have escaped the attention because of its perfect correlation with pressure and harder technical measurement. In this article, we analyze the evidence in hand to compare flow- and pressure-related phenomena to delineate which of the two is the dominant mediator of complications related to hypertension and should be the target for therapy. A ""flow-"" rather than a ""pressure-"" based factor, as the causative or major driving mediator of common hypertensive complications, may change our understanding of hypertension pathophysiology."
196,Sodium and potassium intake and high blood pressure.,"Much circumstantial and some direct evidence links a high sodium, low potassium intake to the development of essential hypertension. However, studies to prove a definite causative relationship in man are unlikely to be done for the practical reason that they need to be carried out over a whole generation. Restriction of sodium intake does lower blood pressure in many hypertensive subjects. This fall appears to be mediated in part by a diminished renin response to the sodium restriction as blood pressure becomes more severe. Less substantive evidence also suggests that increasing potassium intake may lower blood pressure but this effect seems to be more apparent when both animals and man are on a high sodium intake. It would seem sensible, therefore, in the light of present knowledge, to advise communities that have a high sodium, low potassium diet they they may benefit from a reduction in sodium and an increase in potassium intake. Patients who are already known to have high blood pressure should be advised to reduce sodium intake along with other non-pharmacological advice. In some patients this will be sufficient to control the blood pressure. In others who may then require drug treatment, the blood pressure lowering effect of beta-blockers and converting enzyme inhibitors will be enhanced by the sodium restriction."
197,[The oral cavity condition in patients with high blood pressure].,"The incidence of high blood pressure in adults is estimated at ca. 30-40% of the general population. Both hypertension disease and hypertensive drugs affect the condition of the patients' oral cavity. A review of the current literature shows that disorders most frequently found in the masticatory organ of patients with hypertension include: xerostomia, changes in salivary glands, gum hypertrophy, lichenoid lesions, taste disorders, and paraesthesias. The authors emphasize that patients with high blood pressure, along with the treatment of the underlying disease, should receive prophylactic and therapeutic dental care. This would enable reduction and/or elimination of unpleasant complaints, and also help prevent the emergence of secondary disorders in the patients' oral cavity as a result of hypertension pharmacotherapy."
198,Psoriasis and high blood pressure.,"Introduction: Psoriasis is a chronic skin ailment which can be connected with an increased occurrence of other illnesses, including high blood pressure. Examinees and methods: A prospective study has been conducted which included 70 patients affected by psoriasis, both genders, older than 18 years. Average age being 47,14 (SD= ±15,41) years, from that there were 36 men or 51,43 and 34 women or 48,57%. Average duration of psoriasis was 15,52 (SD=±12,54) years. Results: Frequency of high blood pressure in those affected by psoriasis was 54,28%. Average age of the patients with psoriasis and high blood pressure was 53,79 year (SD=±14,15) and average duration of psoriasis was 17,19 years (SD=±13,51). Average values of PASI score were 16,65. Increase in values of PASI score and high blood pressure were statistically highly related (r=0,36, p=0,0001). Conclusion: Psoriasis was related to high blood pressure and there was a correlation between the severity of psoriasis and high blood pressure."
199,Childhood predictors of high blood pressure.,"Longitudinal studies in children have tracked blood pressure through childhood and from childhood into adult life. However, many children do not maintain their rank during these periods of observation. Several of the factors contributing to maintenance of rank order are reviewed, such as initial level of blood pressure, body size, sexual maturation, and family history of high blood pressure. Children with initially high level of blood pressure are more likely to become adults with high blood pressure, particularly if they are obese as children or become obese as young adults, and if they have a positive family history for hypertension."
200,New high blood pressure guidelines create new at-risk classification: changes in blood pressure classification by JNC 7.,"High blood pressure has become increasingly prevalent and is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) has redefined normal blood pressure as less than 120/80 mm Hg and created a new blood pressure category called ""prehypertension"" for those with a systolic BP of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg. This new blood pressure category was created to identify adults considered to be at risk for developing hypertension and to alert both patients and healthcare providers of the importance of adopting lifestyle changes. Recognition of prehypertension provides important opportunities to prevent hypertension and cardiovascular disease."
201,Causes and effects of high blood pressure: a longitudinal approach to genetic cosegregational analysis.,"Numerous biochemical and physiological phenotypic differences exist between genetically normotensive and hypertensive rats. Only some of these differences, however, are likely to be related to the primary mechanisms causing high blood pressure. Others, and perhaps the majority, will be the result of either the secondary effects of hypertension or the result of incidental genetic differences between the strains that bear no relationship to the difference in blood pressure. Cosegregational analysis by cross-breeding normotensive and hypertensive strains permits the identification of phenotypes that are genetically linked to high blood pressure. However, cosegregational analyses are still prone to the confounding effects of hypertension per se, which can obscure important phenotypic traits and might even mimic Mendelian inheritance of phenotypes by producing qualitative shifts in gene expression. This paper discusses a longitudinal approach to genetic analysis designed to increase the sensitivity with which primary causes of high blood pressure are identified, by beginning the analysis during the development of high blood pressure. At this stage, phenotypic abnormalities causing blood pressure to rise are most likely to be present, and the blood pressure elevation is small so that the confounding effects of elevated arterial pressure are minimized."
202,Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in clinical practice: a review.,"Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring offers the ability to collect blood pressure readings several times an hour across a 24-hour period. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring facilitates the identification of white-coat hypertension, the phenomenon whereby certain individuals who are not taking antihypertensive medication show elevated blood pressure in a clinical setting but show nonelevated blood pressure averages when assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. In addition, readings can be segmented into time windows of particular interest, for example, mean daytime and nighttime values. During sleep, blood pressure typically decreases, or dips, such that mean sleep blood pressure is lower than mean awake blood pressure. A nondipping pattern and nocturnal hypertension are strongly associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Approximately 70% of individuals have blood pressure dips of ≥10% at night, whereas 30% have nondipping patterns, when blood pressure remains similar to daytime average or occasionally increases above daytime average. The various blood pressure categorizations afforded by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring are valuable for clinical management of high blood pressure because they increase the accuracy for diagnosis and the prediction of cardiovascular risk."
203,High blood pressure and cerebral white matter lesion progression in the general population.,"High blood pressure is considered an important risk factor for cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) in the aging population. In a longitudinal population-based study of 665 nondemented persons, we investigated the longitudinal relationship of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure with annual progression of WMLs. Means of blood pressure were calculated over a 5-year period before longitudinal MRI scanning. WML progression was subsequently measured on 2 scans 3.5 years apart. We performed analyses with linear regression models and evaluated adjustments for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and baseline WML volume. In addition, we evaluated whether treatment of hypertension is related to less WML progression. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly associated with annual WML progression (regression coefficient [95% confidence interval], 0.08 [0.03; 0.14] mL/y and 0.09 [0.03; 0.15] mL/y per SD increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively). Pulse pressure was also significantly associated with WML progression, but not independent from hypertension. After adjustment for baseline WML volume, only systolic blood pressure remained significantly associated: 0.05 (0.00; 0.09) mL/y per SD increase. People with uncontrolled untreated hypertension had significantly more WML progression than people with uncontrolled treated hypertension (difference [95% confidence interval], 0.12 [0.00; 0.23] mL/y). The present study further establishes high blood pressure to precede WMLs and implies that hypertension treatment could reduce WML progression in the general population."
204,Canadian national high blood pressure prevention and control strategy.,"Despite major efforts to prevent and control high blood pressure, it is one of the most common and important health problems facing Canadians. To address this issue, Health Canada, in collaboration with the Canadian Coalition for High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control, established an Expert Working Group to prepare a national strategy. The present report outlines a strategy to prevent and control high blood pressure. It is directed at policy makers at the local, provincial, and/or territorial and national levels in both the health and nonhealth sectors. The strategy is based on current research and expertise. A multifaceted, comprehensive approach is proposed because there is no one intervention that will accomplish the goal of improving the health of Canadians through high blood pressure prevention and control. The present report focuses on the general population. It does not address the unique needs of children, pregnant women or aboriginal peoples. Each of these groups needs to be studied in its own right, and, in particular, with the involvement of aboriginal people themselves. An implementation committee has been established to realize this strategy, and the Canadian Hypertension Society is a key stakeholder in this effort. Several initiatives are underway. Strong advocates are necessary to increase public awareness and to support the system changes required for a successful public health approach to reduce the prevalence of hypertension and its complications."
205,[Hypertensive urgency or high blood pressure variability?].,"Hypertensive urgency (HU) is a common reason particularly for elderly patients to seek medical advice. Severe asymptomatic hypertension and situational high blood pressure (BP) in patients with its high variability is frequently taken as HU. The use of short-acting antihypertensive drugs is not only indicated in these situations, but it may also increase the risk of cardiovascular events (CVE). Over the past decade, increased BP variability is an independent predictor for a higher risk of CVE. Among the major groups of antihypertensive drugs, there are calcium antagonists, mainly amlodipine, which has the greatest potential to reduce BP variability. Thus, calcium antagonists can be considered as first-line drugs for patients with high BP variability."
206,Assessment of drug compliance in patients with high blood pressure resistant to antihypertensive therapy.,"The persistence of high blood pressure under antihypertensive treatment (resistant hypertension) entails an increased cardiovascular risk. It occurs in three of ten treated hypertensive patients, and has several possible contributing factors, notably insufficient therapeutic adherence. There are a number of ways to evaluate whether patients take their medication as prescribed. These include interviewing the patient, pill counting, prescription follow-up, assay of drugs in blood or urine, and use of electronic pill dispensers. None is perfect. However, the essential is to discuss with the patient the importance of complying with the treatment as soon as it is prescribed for the first time, and not waiting for the appearance of resistant hypertension. The measurement of blood pressure outside the medical office and the monitoring of adherence may help to identify patients in whom hypertension is truly resistant and so to tailor the measures required to improve the control of blood pressure in the most appropriate manner."
207,[High blood pressure in the emergency department: epidemiology and evaluation of a dedicated consultation].,"Objectives: The Arterial High blood pressure represents a consultation on 5 in general medicine. The main objective of our study was to estimate patients' proportion appearing at emergency department (ED) with a high Blood pressure and to demonstrate that it is possible to detect the patients at risk of essential and secondary hypertension as well as their cardiovascular risk there. Methods: Non-interventional forward-looking Study led over 6 weeks. After measure of the vital parameters in the reception of ED, the patients were included if the Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) was ≥ 140 mmHg and\or Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg. A control of Blood Pressure (BP) was made at least 40 minutes after the inclusion. If the Arterial High blood pressure persisted (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg and age < 30 years or BP ≥ 180/110 mmHg after 30 years), the patients had to see again a cardiologist of the hospital in 7 days because they were considered as at high cardiovascular risk. Results: A high initial BP was discovered to 582 (8,7 %) 6685 patients having consulted in ED during the period of the study. 64 % of them (n = 372) had a persistent Arterial High Blood pressure after 40 minutes. 27 patients, defined at high cardiovascular risk had a proposition of consultation of cardiology, appeared 11 to it. 4 secondary hypertension was discovered. Conclusion: During the period of study, 582 patients presented a High BP. To 64 % of those who had a control of BP this imbalance was confirmed. The patients (n=27) presenting a high cardiovascular risk had a proposition of fast consultation. This one allowed discovering 4 secondary hypertension. There is thus a utility to estimate the BP in a systematic way at Emergency Department."
208,Evidence for the reaffirmation of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation on screening for high blood pressure.,"Background: High blood pressure is common, and screening is a well-established evidence-based standard of current medical practice. Purpose: To perform a literature search for new, substantial evidence on screening for high blood pressure that would inform the reaffirmation of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation on screening for high blood pressure. Data sources: The PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched. The searches were limited to English-language articles on studies of adult humans (age >18 years) that were published between 1 October 2001 and 31 March 2006 in core clinical journals. Study selection: For the literature on benefits, meta-analyses; systematic reviews; and randomized, controlled trials were included. For harms, meta-analyses; systematic reviews; randomized, controlled trials; cohort studies; case-control studies; and case series of large, multisite databases were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full articles for inclusion. Data extraction: No new evidence was found on benefits or harms of screening. Two reviewers extracted data from studies on the harms of early treatment, including adverse effects of drug therapy and adverse quality-of-life outcomes. Data synthesis: No new evidence was found for the benefits of screening for high blood pressure. New evidence on the harms of treatment of early hypertension shows that pharmacologic therapy is associated with common side effects; serious adverse events are uncommon. Limitations: The nonsystematic search may have missed some smaller studies on the benefits and harms of screening and treatment for high blood pressure. Conclusion: No new evidence was found on the benefits of screening. Pharmacotherapy for early hypertension is associated with common side effects."
209,[Unhealthy behavior associated with the development of high blood pressure in adolescents].,"This article aims to evaluate the association between unhealthy behavior pattern and prevalence and incidence of high blood pressure in adolescents. Based on data from a cohort study with a baseline population of 2,813 adolescents enrolled in a public school system, the study measured the baseline prevalence and incidence of high blood pressure as a function of smoking, alcohol and illegal drug use, and physical activity. These variables were used to build a model called ""unhealthy behavior pattern"", and its relationship was evaluated in relation to high blood pressure in adolescents, using multiple logistic regression models. Prevalence of high blood pressure was 8.67%. Accumulated incidence of high blood pressure was 7.58%. In the multivariate analysis of high blood pressure adjusted by degree of adiposity, there was an association with the unhealthy behavior pattern in males (OR = 3.13; 95%CI: 1.67-5.84). The association between incidence of high blood pressure and unhealthy behavior pattern was observed in females (OR = 2.34; 95%CI: 1.11-4.95). In conclusion, high blood pressure is present in the adolescent population, associated with unhealthy behaviors like smoking, alcohol and illegal drug use, and physical inactivity, independently of the degree of adiposity."
210,Income inequality and high blood pressure in Colombia: a multilevel analysis.,"The objective of this research was to examine the association between income inequality and high blood pressure in Colombia. Using a nationally representative Colombian sample of adults, and data from departments and municipalities, we fit sex-stratified linear and logistic multilevel models with blood pressure as a continuous and binary variable, respectively. In adjusted models, women living in departments with the highest quintile of income inequality in 1997 had higher systolic blood pressure than their counterparts living in the lowest quintile of income inequality (mean difference 4.42mmHg; 95%CI: 1.46, 7.39). Women living in departments that were at the fourth and fifth quintile of income inequality in 1994 were more likely to have hypertension than those living in departments at the first quintile in the same year (OR: 1.56 and 1.48, respectively). For men, no associations of income inequality with either systolic blood pressure or hypertension were observed. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that income inequality is associated with increased risk of high blood pressure for women. Future studies to analyze pathways linking income inequality to high blood pressure in Colombia are needed."
211,Potential Impact of the 2017 High Blood Pressure Guideline Beyond the United States: A Case Study of the People's Republic of China.,"Background: The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) (US) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults expanded the definition of hypertension and now considers atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in determining treatment for people with hypertension. US guidelines are influential around the world and it is therefore justified to study their impact in other settings. Our study determined the impact of adopting the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline in China. Methods: We analyzed the population impact of the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline using the 2011-2012 year of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a nationally representative sample of Chinese adults 45-74 years of age (n = 11,822). Our analysis was unique because for the first time it used a population-appropriate equation to calculate ASCVD risk instead of the US Pooled Cohort Equation (the latter misrepresents risk in non-US populations). Results: Adopting the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline in China would increase the prevalence of hypertension from 44.1% to 56.4% (12.3 percentage points) and increase the number of adults recommended for antihypertensive medication from 41.6% to 49.1% (7.5 percentage points) in the 45-74-year age range. According to Chinese (but not US) risk calculations, the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline more selectively assigns antihypertensive medication to patients at higher risk for ASCVD. Conclusions: The 2017 ACC/AHA guideline brings potential for risk reduction in China and selectively recommends medication for those who would benefit most. Realizing such benefits would ultimately depend on the acceptance, adherence, and feasibility of adopting this guideline."
212,[Outpatient blood pressure monitoring is not always necessary].,"It is clear that clinical measurements of blood pressure can lead to errors in the diagnostic process and follow-up of patients with hypertension. Scientific societies recommend other measurement methods, such as home measurements and outpatient monitoring. Outpatient monitoring might be the golden standard but, nowadays has an important limitation-its availability. Home measurements solve 80-90% of the doubts of the diagnostic process and follow-up of patients with hypertension, and its higher availability and acceptance by the patient are clear. Home measurements should be used in the diagnostic process of arterial hypertension as a screening test for white coat hypertension and masked hypertension. They should be used as a screening test for resistant hypertension in the follow-up of patients with high blood pressure. Besides, in the follow-up of patients with hypertension home measurements have shown that they can contribute to treatment adherence, reduce clinical inertia and make data teletransmission possible, aspects that have proven to help improve the degree of control of hypertensive patients. Therefore, home measurements would be the treatment of choice for the diagnosis and follow-up of most patients with hypertension. We should consider home measurements and outpatient monitoring as complementary methods for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with high blood pressure."
213,[High blood pressure in the hospital: intensify medication or ignore?].,"High blood pressure is a common finding in hospitalized patients. Anxiety, pain and fever can all increase blood pressure to various degrees. The question is whether this adaptive response is harmful and should lead to initiation or intensification of treatment or can be ignored. A recent retrospective study has shown that intensification of blood pressure lowering medication in patients who are hospitalized with non-cardiac conditions is associated with a higher incidence of in-hospital complications, in particular myocardial infarction and renal insufficiency, while another study demonstrated that patients who are discharged from hospital with intensified antihypertensive treatment have an increased risk of readmission without a reduction in cardiac events after one year. Although retrospective in nature, these data show that we should be careful with anti-hypertensive medication in patients hospitalized for non-cardiac conditions and that blood pressure monitoring should be focused on the identification of low rather than high blood pressure values."
214,"Hypertension: Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines.","Purpose of review: Hypertension has been recognized for decades as a major factor for stroke, with observational epidemiologic studies clearly identifying the increased stroke risks with blood pressure (BP) levels and randomized controlled clinical trials providing evidence of stroke risk reduction with lower BPs. Hypertension treatment and management guidelines, the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) reports, have recognized the high impact of elevated BPs and influenced lower BPs with subsequent stroke risk reduction. In particular, the previous seven JNC reports included an evolution of SBP levels for treatment. This review addresses the influences of the JNC reports on stroke outcomes and describes the potential efforts of the upcoming guidelines. Recent findings: The recommendations of lower SBPs from the earlier reports were consistent with lower population BP shifts during the time period. The next JNC report will have a major focus on graded evidence from randomized clinical trials with detailed strategies and subsequent impact on stroke risks. Summary: The impact of the evidence-based guidelines will be expected to have enhanced effects on stroke rates by providing clinicians with current treatment and management recommendations."
215,National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group Report on Hypertension in the Elderly. National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group.,"Raised blood pressures in the elderly and the increased prevalence of hypertension in this population are not benign occurrences and should not be viewed as a normal or inevitable consequence of aging. In fact, the relation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures to cardiovascular events is generally more pronounced in people aged 65 years and older when compared with those aged 35 to 64. The relative risk of cardiovascular disease is greater among the elderly at every level of blood pressure. Furthermore, the absolute likelihood that an older individual will have a cardiovascular event is substantially greater than for someone younger, reflecting the increased prevalence of other cardiovascular disease risk factors in this age group. Thus, equivalent blood pressure reduction is likely to produce a greater benefit in the elderly than in younger patients at every level of blood pressure. This report, an update of the 1985 Working Group Report on Hypertension in the Elderly, has two aims: to guide clinicians in their care of elderly patients with hypertension and to assist health care professionals participating in high blood pressure control programs that serve the elderly. The role of lifestyle modifications--weight loss, dietary sodium restriction, alcohol reduction, and exercise--as definitive or adjunctive therapy to drug treatment is discussed. In addition, the report reviews the relative advantages and disadvantages of the specific classes of antihypertensive medications."
216,[High blood pressure and physical exercise].,"High blood pressure is a frequent pathology with many cardiovascular complications. As highlighted in guidelines, the therapeutic management of hypertension relies on non-pharmacological measures, which are diet and regular physical activity, but both patients and physicians are reluctant to physical activity prescription. To acquire the conviction that physical activity is beneficial, necessary and possible, we can take into account some fundamental and clinical studies, as well as the feedback of our clinical practice. Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and hypertension contributes to increase this risk. Conversely, regular practice of physical activity decreases very significantly the risk by up to 60%. The acute blood pressure changes during exercise and post-exercise hypotension differs according to the dynamic component (endurance or aerobic and/or strength exercises), but the repetition of the sessions leads to the chronic hypotensive benefit of physical activity. Moreover, physical activity prescription must take into account the assessment of global cardiovascular risk, the control of the hypertension, and the opportunities and desires of the patient in order to promote good adherence and beneficial lifestyle change."
217,National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group Report on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy.,"This consensus report focuses the presentation, pathophysiology, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy expanding on recommendations first presented in 1988 by the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Practicing physicians should determine whether a patient's hypertension during pregnancy falls into the classification of (1) chronic hypertension, (2) preeclampsia, (3) preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension, or (4) transient hypertension. The distinction, for management considerations, is made between hypertension that is present before pregnancy (chronic and preexisting) and that occurring as part of the pregnancy-specific condition preeclampsia. When maternal blood pressure reaches diastolic levels of 100 mm Hg or greater, treatment should be instituted to avoid hypertensive vascular damage. The report includes a discussion of antihypertensive therapy specific to the chronic or acute hypertension occurring concomitantly with pregnancy. The roles of calcium supplementation and low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia and chronic and transient hypertension are under investigation."
218,"[Producing know-how and making recommendations for promoting high blood pressure management in Colombia , 1998-2005].","Objective: Producing know-how and making recommendations concerning the most effective health promotion community interventions for managing high blood pressure in Colombia. Methods: A systematic review was made of the Cochrane, Lilacs, Ovid, Proquest and Pubmed databases, the main interest of the study lying within the framework of the most effective community interventions around the world for managing high blood pressure. The following search words were used: systematic review, community intervention, cost effectiveness, health promotion and high blood pressure. Studies published in Spanish, English and Portuguese were reviewed. The research strategies used were derived from defining the most pertinent methodological approach for involving individual, interpersonal and community levels in developing the project. Results: 1,041 articles were obtained from the systematic review of the literature: 246 abstracts, 197 articles about educational interventions for preventing and controlling high blood pressure and 53 articles adopting different approaches regarding informative interventions and communication. Only 11 complete referenced articles from this world of information fulfilled the levels of evidence and evaluation criteria necessary for producing recommendations. Conclusions: The available evidence concerning effective, culturally-suitable programmes and for promoting a reduction in these risk factors is limited. Greater evidence regarding community interventions is required for reducing risk factors directed towards special population groups adapted to the cultural characteristics of the participating population. This must involve determinants of the social and physical context related to social practices, these being developed on a large scale within the daily settings in which the subjects and their families are living."
219,Comparison of high-risk and mass strategies for the prevention of high blood pressure.,"A mass strategy for the prevention of high blood pressure and its complications is likely to be more effective than high-risk strategies for several reasons: there is no practicable way of identifying in advance a large proportion of future hypertensives; a minority of hypertensive complications occur in individuals with pressures high enough to warrant treatment; and treatment has little or no effect on the incidence of the major hypertensive complication, coronary heart attacks. The effect of a broad-based dietary prevention programme is not proven, but such a strategy offers a reasonable prospect of a broad range of benefits, and is likely to prove acceptable to the general public. A family-based approach may contribute to aetiological research, and make pragmatic sense in clinical practice, but does not provide a scientific basis for a high-risk strategy of prevention."
220,Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.,"Noninvasive, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has evolved over the past 25 years from a novel research tool of limited clinical use into an important and useful modality for stratifying cardiovascular risk and guiding therapeutic decisions. Early clinical uses of ABPM were mostly focused on identifying patients with white-coat hypertension; however, accumulated evidence now points to greater prognostic significance in determining risk for hypertensive end-organ damage compared with office blood pressure measurements. Ambulatory measurement of blood pressure using automated devices has also demonstrated benefit in other indications, such as treatment resistance and borderline hypertension, and is recommended by the Joint National Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in a number of clinical scenarios. Medicare recently announced plans to begin reimbursement for ABPM, which will likely increase demand for ABPM services. Clinicians should become familiar with the role of this technology in the care of the hypertensive patient."
221,"A review of the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.","Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. After decades of improvement, population surveys demonstrate disturbing downward trends in the rates of awareness, treatment, and control of this disorder in recent years. Over this same time period, there has been a slight increase in the incidence of strokes, and a steady rise in the incidence of end-stage renal disease and the prevalence of congestive heart failure, conditions in which hypertension plays a prominent role. Results of recent studies support the possibility that lifestyle modifications may be effective for prevention of hypertension. Treatment of established hypertension involves lifestyle modifications and drug therapies designed to control blood pressure and reduce overall cardiovascular risk. Both threshold blood pressure levels for initiating drug therapy and goal blood pressure levels with treatment are individually determined based on the presence or absence of additional cardiovascular risk factors and hypertension target organ injury or clinical cardiovascular disease. Recent clinical trials support the value of lower goal blood pressures for patients with diabetes, heart failure, and renal disease. The presence or absence of comorbid conditions often determines specific drug choices. Diuretics and beta-blockers remain the drugs of choice in uncomplicated hypertension. Additional studies confirm the benefits of treating isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly. The Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure provides a practical, evidence-based resource to help health care providers meet the public health challenges of preventing and controlling hypertension."
222,Prevalence of pre-high blood pressure and high blood pressure among non-overweight children and adolescents using international blood pressure references in developed regions in China.,"Background: There is a lack of data on the prevalence of pre-high blood pressure (PreHBP) and high blood pressure (HBP), based on recent international blood pressure references, in non-overweight children and adolescents. Aim: To describe the prevalence of PreHBP and HBP in non-overweight children and adolescents in developed regions of China. Subjects and methods: In total, 588 097 non-overweight children and adolescents aged 6-17 years from the National Surveys on Chinese Students' Constitution and Health in 2015 were included. Results: The prevalence of PreHBP was 13.41% and subjects in urban areas had a higher prevalence of PreHBP (14.14%) than those in rural areas (12.92%). Subjects in regions with a high (13.56%) or moderate (13.61%) socioeconomic status showed a higher prevalence of PreHBP than those in regions with a relatively low socioeconomic status (12.76%). A similar pattern was found for the prevalence of HBP, and the prevalence of HBP was 18.25% for all participants, 20.55% for subjects in urban areas, 16.71% in rural areas, 18.76% in high socioeconomic areas, 18.62% in moderate socioeconomic areas and 16.70% in relatively low socioeconomic areas. Conclusion: A large proportion of non-overweight children and adolescents had elevated blood pressure and there were urban-rural and socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of elevated blood pressure."
223,Prevalence and control of high blood pressure in primary care: results from the German Metabolic and Cardiovascular Risk Study (GEMCAS).,"Contemporary epidemiological data on blood pressure readings, hypertension prevalence and control in unselected patient populations covering a broad age range are scarce. The aim here is to report the prevalence of high blood pressure and to identify factors associated with blood pressure control in a large German primary care sample. We used data from the German Metabolic and Cardiovascular Risk Study including 35 869 patients aged 18-99 years. High blood pressure was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg or using antihypertensive therapy. Factors associated with blood pressure control among patients receiving antihypertensive therapy were examined using multiple logistic regressions to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The prevalence of high blood pressure, uncontrolled high blood pressure and untreated high blood pressure was 54.8%, 21.3% and 17.6%, respectively. Age >50 years (1.52; 1.40-1.65), male sex (1.30; 1.20-1.41), elevated waist circumference (1.55; 1.45-1.65), high cholesterol (1.24; 1.16-1.33), high triglycerides (1.11; 1.04-1.19) and concomitant diabetes (1.29; 1.20-1.40) were independently associated with uncontrolled high blood pressure. In a majority of patients we observed hypertension despite treatment for high blood pressures. Studies examining the reasons for treatment failure are highly warranted."
224,"Hypertension and the eye: applications of the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.","Background: High blood pressure is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, kidney disease, and stroke. More people are aware of treating and controlling their blood pressure, but overall control rates are low and the incidence of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality remains high. Methods: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute released The Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) as the most recent national guideline to hypertension control for primary care clinicians. Results: JNC VI identifies 10 hypertension-related public health challenges: (1) prevent the rise of blood pressure; (2) decrease prevalence of hypertension; (3) increase awareness and detection of hypertension; (4) improve control of hypertension; (5) reduce cardiovascular risks; (6) increase recognition of importance of isolated systolic hypertension; (7) improve recognition of importance of high-normal blood pressure; (8) reduce ethnic, socioeconomic, and regional variations; (9) improve treatment; and (10) enhance community programs. Conclusions: The eye is a target organ and retinopathy is a frequent complication--as well as a prognostic indicator--of sustained hypertension. As part of a multidisciplinary team approach, the optometrist assumes a significant role in the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure and its associated morbidities."
225,[THE TREATMENT OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MUST BE TAILOR-MADE].,"Hypertension has a high world-wide prevalence, affecting more than 25 % of the population; it remains the silent killer number one in cardiovascular pathology. Although lowering high blood pressure is protective, perfect control of hypertension is far from being optimal in spite of many international guidelines regularly updated according to published scientific studies. A personalized approach of hypertension management is an attractive way to improve this situation. Tools are developing (pharmacogenetics, pharmacometabolomics), but their use in daily clinical practice seems premature. At the present time, it is the physician experience which offers the best opportunity to propose the best treatment to the best patient. The management of hypertension remains a difficult task in some cases. Patient education is also crucial to improve drug compliance."
226,"[The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure: the weapons are ready].","The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) has recently came to light in a short version. A complete version will soon be available. JNC 7 is the last attempt to bridge the big gap between the current availability of potent and well tolerated antihypertensive strategies and their poor implementation in the clinical practice. Some new and important features characterize the JNC 7 document. The aim of the new and challenging definition of pre-hypertension (BP 120-139/80-89 mmHg) is to sensitize the general population and health professionals to implement effective strategies for a healthier life in order to prevent hypertension and related cardiovascular disease as early as possible. Stage 3 hypertension has been deleted and merged with stage 2 (systolic > or = 160 or diastolic > or = 100 mmHg). BP levels to achieve with treatment (goals) are < 140/90 mmHg (< 130/80 mmHg in diabetics). To reach the goal, diuretics are recommended for initial treatment in most subjects with stage I hypertension. However, combination of at least 2 drugs is recommended if initial BP is 20/10 mmHg higher than goal BP. Apart from the definition of pre-hypertension and the advice to begin therapy with diuretics in most patients with stage 1 hypertension, JNC 7 shares several positions with the hypertension guidelines recently released by the European Society of Cardiology and European Society of Hypertension. JNC 7 seems to dedicate limited space to stratify the level of cardiovascular risk in the individual subjects on the basis of the different combinations between BP levels and concomitant risk factors. In summary, JNC 7 is an updated and well equipped arsenal of formidable weapons against hypertension and its complications. The stage is now set for an hard task: their effective implementation in the clinical practice with the aim to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
227,"[Prevalence of high blood pressure in children and adolescents from the city of Maceio, Brazil].","Objectives: To define the prevalence of high blood pressure in a representative sample of children and adolescents from the city of Maceió, state of Alagoas, Brazil, and to investigate the association of high blood pressure with age, sex and nutritional status. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out from May 2000 to September 2002. Individuals between 7 and 17 years of age were selected among all the 185,702 students from public and private schools. The size of the sample was defined based on the expected prevalence of hypertension for the age group. After randomization, data were collected through a questionnaire. Blood pressure was measured twice. Weight and height were also measured. High blood pressure was defined as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure over the 95th percentile in one or in both measures. Results: The final sample included 1,253 students (706 females). One hundred and eighteen students had high blood pressure (mean age 13 years; 44% males). Risk of being overweight and excess weight were identified, respectively, in 9.3 and 4.5% of the students. These variables were significantly associated with high blood pressure. Conclusions: The prevalence of high blood pressure was 9.4%. High blood pressure was significantly more frequent among overweight students and among those at risk for being overweight."
228,[Management of high blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease : Summary of recent guidelines].,"Chronic kidney disease and high blood pressure are two common diseases that mutually maintain during their evolution. In the advanced stages of chronic kidney disease, most pat ients are hypertensive and show signs of vascular disease (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular or peripheral). Almost one third of the patients with advanced chronic kidney disease exhibit resistant hypertension that requires complex therapeutic management. In chronic kidney disease, antihypertensive treatment is conditioned by comorbidities, but also by proteinuria, which is an independent cardiovascular risk factor in addition to the rate of glomerular filtration rate. The treatment of high blood pressure is a cornerstone of the management of the chronic kidney disease. It limits the risk of cardiovascular events (eg. myocardial infarction, stroke), but also slows the progression of chronic kidney disease. Various recommendations have been recently published on the subject in order to offer assistance to the therapeutic management of hypertension in the patient suffering from chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this article is to highlight these main key elements."
229,"Blood pressure measurement device selection in low-resource settings: Challenges, compromises, and routes to progress.","High blood pressure (BP) is the single leading preventable cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor across the world. In order to decrease the global burden of CVD, broad hypertension screening programs that facilitate early hypertension diagnosis and treatment are essential. Accurate BP devices are a key element of hypertension control programs. With the overwhelming number of devices available now on the market, most of which have not been tested for accuracy, it can be challenging to select the optimal BP measurement device for clinical settings. This review details essential factors to consider when selecting a good-quality BP device, particularly for use in low-resource settings. Barriers to the procurement and use of good-quality devices are reviewed and practical solutions proposed."
230,High blood pressure--current state of play.,"Blood pressure is well recognised and well treated in Australia; nevertheless, a number of problem areas still exist. The author looks at the management of hypertension in the elderly, factors affecting choice of drug and the place of cost-benefit analysis in choosing a drug for treatment of hypertension."
231,Suitability of blood-pressure-to-height ratio as the criterion for high blood pressure in children in an environmental study.,"Background: Blood-pressure-to-height ratio is considered a simple, accurate, inexpensive and non-age-dependent index for screening high blood pressure in a clinical setting, but its suitability in epidemiological surveys was not taken into consideration. The aim of this study was to test the suitability of blood-pressure-to-height ratio against blood pressure for age percentiles for the identification of high blood pressure in an environmental study. Methods: The sample consisted of 2195 children, aged 3 to 15 years, whose blood pressure was measured as part of an environmental study in Belgrade, Serbia. High blood pressure was estimated using percentiles (gold standard) and blood-pressure-to-height ratios for systolic and diastolic pressures separately (proposed criterion). The optimal cut-offs of the blood-pressure-to-height ratio (BPHR) were selected based on Youden's index (sensitivity + specificity - 1) calculated from the receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. Results: The proposed criterion identified five times more cases of high blood pressure in the investigated children of all age groups in comparison to the gold standard. The optimal cut-off values were selected based on the sensitivity and specificity values by age groups and gender. Conclusion: Blood-pressure-to-height ratio can be a reliable criterion for the estimation of high blood pressure in epidemiological studies. This is the first study on the applicability of blood-pressure-to-height ratio in Serbian children, but it may not be easily generalized to other populations due to small sample size across the examined age groups and potential diversities in risk factors for high blood pressure. Applied in epidemiological studies, BPHR would help researchers estimate the role of certain environmental factors on blood pressure in children."
232,The employee high blood pressure program of the National Institutes of Health.,"Adequate control of high blood pressure remains a significant problem for many hypertensives detected through screening programs. The worksite is an ideal place in which to help workers control their high blood pressure. The Occupational Medical Service (OMS) at the National Institutes of Health developed and implemented a protocol to screen, refer, follow up, and monitor hypertensive employees. Approximately one-half of the workers were screened at a cost of $1.70 per employee. Alternative approaches to improving the effectiveness of a building-to-building screening program were suggested. Of the employees screened, 85.3 percent had normal blood pressure, 7.8 percent had borderline blood pressure, and 6.9 percent had high blood pressure. The two-steps screening process reduced by one-third the number of persons referred for evaluation of persistently high blood pressure. Among the hypertensive employees on treatment, 53.7 percent had normal readings. Of the 263 newly diagnosed and poorly controlled hypertensives who were referred to their private physicians for care, 73 percent were actually evaluated. Measures to increase the likelihood of a successful referral and followup included providing a list of medical resources in the community and assigning a nurse rather than a clear to contact employees for a repeat blood pressure check. Monitoring and education services are being provided to 70 percent of the known hypertensives. Adequate blood pressure control in NIH employees has improved by one-third as a result of the program."
233,"High blood pressure: definitions, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.","Although it is well established that high blood pressure (BP) levels of 140/90 mmHg or higher are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality it has not been as well appreciated that lower BP levels, namely those considered to be in the ""normotensive"" range, also confer an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Recent data from the Framingham Heart Study have demonstrated that high normal levels (i.e. SBP = 130-139 and/or DBP = 85-89 mmHg) frequently progress to hypertension, are associated with structural and functional cardiovascular alterations, an atherogenic metabolic profile and/or a comorbid condition, and an increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Factors that predispose to progression to hypertension include higher SBP and body weight at baseline and weight gain. In low risk subjects with high normal BP, nonpharmacologic measures, especially salt restriction and weight reduction are often adequate to lower BP to < or = 130/80. In those with a high cardiovascular risk profile, BP should be reduced to < or = 120/80 with nonpharmacologic measures and pharmacotherapy."
234,"Chagas disease, a risk factor for high blood pressure.","Background: Chagas disease is a parasite infection caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Its most common complications is chronic Chagas heart disease but impairments of the systemic vasculature also has been observed. Although the different mechanisms that regulate blood pressure are disrupted, to our knowledge data on the association of hypertension and chronic Chagas disease are scarce. In this regard we evaluate whether Chagas disease constitutes a high blood pressure risk factor. Materials and methods: We recruited 200 individuals, half of them with positive serology for T. cruzi. They were subjected to a complete clinical examination. Results: The mean age of sampled individuals was 46.7 ± 12.3, and the mean of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 124 ± 12 mmHg and 82 ± 10 mmHg, respectively. There were no between-group differences regarding age, sex distribution or body mass index. Chagas disease contributed significantly to high blood pressure (OR = 4, 95% CI 1.8323-7.0864, p = 0.0002). Conclusion: Our results reveal an important association between Chagas disease and high blood pressure, which should be contemplated by physicians in order to promote preventive cardiovascular actions in patients with Chagas disease."
235,Association of body mass index and waist circumference with high blood pressure in older adults.,"Background: The relationship between obesity and prevalent high blood pressure in older adults has predominantly been estimated using categorical measures of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), masking the shape of the dose-response relationship. We aimed to examine the precise relationship of BMI, WC with high blood pressure and to assess the appropriate level of BMI and WC for high blood pressure. Methods: We examined data for 126,123 individuals in Xinzheng city aged ≥60 years from a population based study from January to December 2019. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models were applied to assess the relationship and the appropriate level of BMI and WC for high blood pressure. An additive interaction analysis was used to test synergistic effects between a higher BMI and WC for high blood pressure. Results: The full-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of an increase of 1 kg/m2 in BMI and 1 cm in WC for high blood pressure were 1.084 (1.080-1.087) and 1.026(1.024-1.027), respectively. Multivariable adjusted restricted cubic spline analyses showed the nonlinear relationships of BMI and WC with high blood pressure in both men and women (all P < 0.001). The risk of high blood pressure increased steeply with increasing BMI from ≥25 kg/m2 and WC ≥ 88 cm or 86 cm for males and females, respectively. And we observed a significant additive interaction between a higher BMI and WC such that the prevalence of high blood pressure was significantly enhanced. Conclusion: These findings suggest increased high blood pressure prevalence in the older adults with increased BMI and WC. BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2 and WC ≤ 88 cm or 86 cm for males and females may be the best suggestion with regard to primary prevention of high blood pressure in older adults."
236,Very high blood pressure in acute stroke.,"In a study sample consisting of 388 unselected, consecutive acute stroke patients, 27 with systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 200 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 115 mmHg were compared with the other 361 patients. The patients with high blood pressure were younger (65 vs. 73 years) and much more often had a history of hypertension (78 vs. 42%). Cardiac and vascular hypertensive manifestations were more frequent, particularly when only those patients with a history of hypertension were compared in the two groups. Alcohol abuse was mentioned in a higher proportion of hypertensives in the summaries of their medical records. No definite conclusions could be drawn with regard to the size and location of the brain lesions. Clinical symptoms did not differ between the groups, neither did the proportion of patients who could be discharged from hospital immediately. Mortality was higher in the high blood pressure group (30 vs. 14%, P less than 0.05). Thus the characteristics of patients with very high blood pressure were: younger age, much more frequent and severe previous hypertension. Alcohol abuse might be an important factor. The type, size and location of the brain lesion itself could not be statistically related to the high blood pressure, but very large lesions, particularly haemorrhages, might be associated with a reactive blood pressure response."
237,Monitoring pediatric blood pressure at dental appointments.,"Numerous studies have tracked blood pressure from adolescence into adulthood. It is increasingly apparent that the recent increase in obesity and resultant end-organ effects of hypertension originates in childhood. Pediatric hypertension is a significant health concern that, if left untreated, can affect a child's cardiovascular, endocrine, renal, and neurologic systems. In 2004, the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents recommended that bloodpressure should be monitored in pediatric patients who are at least 3-years-old and that this procedure should be a part of the health care visit in all health facilities, rather than just within the medical office. The purpose of this article was to emphasize the need for following these recommendations at oral care visits and suggest a simplified pediatric blood pressure table that dental clinicians can use to identify children who need referrals to medical facilities for evaluation of blood pressure."
238,Change in blood pressure in offspring of parents with high or low blood pressure: the Dutch Hypertension and Offspring Study.,"A family history of hypertension is an important predictor of high blood pressure. We investigated the question of whether this predisposition affects the level and change of blood pressure early in life, and in particular, at what age the familial aggregation of blood pressure occurs. Blood pressure and related characteristics were studied in children whose parents both had relatively high blood pressure ('high') and the results were compared with those from children whose parents both had a relatively low blood pressure ('low') and with children with one parent high and the other parent low ('mixed'). At the age of 8 years there were no clear differences in pressure but at the age of 20 years there was a difference of 7 mmHg for both systolic and diastolic pressure between the high- and low-risk offspring. These findings suggest that the magnitude of familial aggregation of blood pressure increases during childhood and adolescence."
239,"Patients' views of high blood pressure, its treatment and risks.","Objective: To examine the understanding and beliefs of a sample of Australian patients about high blood pressure and its therapy, and to examine the accuracy of their assessment of their own risk. Method: A cross sectional study in two general practices in Perth, Western Australia. Interviews were conducted with 55 consecutive patients aged 40-80 years of age with uncomplicated hypertension. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected on patients' beliefs about the nature, symptoms, causes and treatment of high blood pressure as well as their adherence to antihypertensive medications during the preceding month. Patients also estimated their own risk of stroke or myocardial infarction. Results: Two-thirds of the patients (65%) described high blood pressure within an appropriate biomedical definition. Forty-five percent attributed a variety of symptoms to their high blood pressure while 55% believed that stress was a cause of their high blood pressure. Three-quarters (73%) were fully adherent to their medications in the preceding month. Seventy-one percent and 62% of patients were aware that stroke and heart attack respectively are possible consequences of high blood pressure. They significantly overestimated their risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. Conclusion: One-third of treated hypertensive patients are poorly informed about the causes and effects of hypertension, and overestimate their risk of both stroke and heart attack, as well as the benefit derived from treatment."
240,"Glomerular hyperfiltration, high renin, and low- extracellular volume in high blood pressure.","Abnormal renovascular resistance and glomerular filtration rate are characteristic of established hypertension and may also be involved in its pathogenesis. To determine renal and body fluid correlates of the predisposition to high blood pressure, we examined 100 healthy young adults with high or low blood pressure. Within each group, half had parents with high blood pressures, and half had parents with low blood pressures. Renal function and hemodynamics, body fluid volumes, and relevant hormones and genotypes were measured. Subjects with high personal and parental blood pressures had the highest levels of glomerular filtration rate (P<0.02) and plasma active renin concentration and low levels of exchangeable sodium and plasma volume (P<0.02). High glomerular filtration rate was not associated with differences in urinary kallikrein or prostaglandins. Polymorphisms of the renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensinogen genes were not associated with differences in glomerular filtration rate or renin. Subjects with high personal, but low parental, blood pressures had low exchangeable sodium and plasma volumes (P<0.02) but normal glomerular filtration rates. In this population, extracellular volume depletion and high renin are correlates of high blood pressure in early adulthood, and glomerular hyperfiltration is a feature of those who also have familial predisposition to high blood pressure."
241,"High blood pressure, oxygen radicals and antioxidants: etiological relationships.","This hypothesis proposes that high blood pressure is a pathological state associated with a loss of the balance between pro-oxidation and antioxidation, energy depletion, and accelerated aging in the target organs, such as heart, kidney and brain. Different nutritional, environmental, pharmacological factors and/or associated pathologies (diabetes, arteriosclerosis, cancer, alcoholism, etc.) and/or genetic components, can induce high blood pressure by breaking the redox equilibrium in the affected organs. Additional evidence, such as increase of oxidative damage, fibrogenesis, inhibition of the cardiocytic sodium-potassium pump, and heart hypertrophy, supports this hypothesis. These facts are analysed in the present paper, showing that they could contribute to the development of high blood pressure and associated pathologies by oxidative mechanisms."
242,An appraisal of the genetic approaches to high blood pressure.,"Background: The genetics of high blood pressure is a growing field. Remarkable discoveries have been made in the rare genetic causes of hypertension. However, if molecular biology is to achieve its full potential it must address more common forms of high blood pressure. The genetics of essential hypertension offers great potential but also presents special challenges. This review examines how genes might influence blood pressure, how we might organize the search for underlying genes, where we should look and the way in which genetic knowledge might be used. Need for broad approach: For reasons related to informative research design and the prevention of cardiovascular disease, genetic approaches need to address the variation of blood pressure from low to high levels, not only hypertension. Need for genetic markers: If there is to be a time when DNA testing will be routine, then it will depend on discovering genetic markers that are informative, reliable and cost-beneficial."
243,"An osteopathic cardiologist's review of hypertension: beyond the Fifth Report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.","Although hypertension was defined more than 100 years ago, it remains the leading cause of office visits and use of prescription drugs. Because hypertension is one of the major risk factors for premature death and disability, the medical community continues to strive toward more aggressive detection, follow-up, and treatment. The Fifth Report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure provides an excellent guide for all health practitioners. This publication, along with several recent articles, have provided a comprehensive approach to the hypertensive patient. Although cerebrovascular events have been dramatically reduced by the treatment of hypertension, results regarding cardiac morbidity and mortality have been disappointing. Therefore, from a cardiologists' standpoint, the concept of cardioprotection has evolved into an important component in the treatment of the hypertensive patient."
244,Home blood pressure monitoring in an anaesthetic pre-admission clinic.,"We suspected that many high blood pressure measurements taken in our anaesthetic pre-assessment clinic and immediately prior to induction of anaesthesia were unusually elevated due to a 'white coat' effect. These high blood pressure measurements were causing late cancellations of surgery, even though white coat measurements may not be representative of the patient's usual blood pressure or of their risk of end-organ damage due to hypertension. In this audit, patients with high blood pressure in our pre-admission clinic were provided with training and a home blood pressure monitor to use prior to surgery. These were compared to the pre-admission clinic measurements to determine the incidence of white coat hypertension. We also compared home to general practice blood pressure monitoring where possible. Fifty-two patients were provided with monitors. Fifty-one of these took at least five measurements at home. Thirty-four (66%) patients had average measurements at home at least 20 mmHg lower than pre-admission clinic measurements. A total of 33% of general practice clinic measurements were also ≥ 20 mmHg higher than average home measurements. White coat hypertension was common in our audit population. Relying on average home blood pressure measurements rather than 'one off' in-hospital measurements may have helped to prevent the postponement or cancellation of surgery for 13 patients who had recorded blood pressure ≥ 180/110 mmHg in our pre-admission clinic."
245,Biased appraisal of high blood pressure.,"Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of individuals' beliefs concerning their own blood pressure level on their appraisals of the seriousness of high blood pressure. In Experiment 1, 40 college students had their blood pressure measured and were randomly assigned to receive either high or normal blood pressure feedback. Afterward, they were asked to rate the seriousness of high blood pressure. Subjects who were given high blood pressure feedback rated the disorder as a less serious threat to health than did those subjects who received normal feedback. The results were replicated in Experiment 2 among a second sample of college students. Experiment 2 also revealed that minimization is associated with the belief that hypertension is an acute or cyclical condition. These experimental findings confirm clinical evidence that minimization is a common initial reaction to threatening medical information."
246,Treatment of hypertension based on measurement of blood pressure variability: lessons from animal studies.,"Purpose of review: Blood pressure variability, a quantitative index for the spontaneous variation in blood pressure, has been proposed as a risk factor for end-organ damage and to determine the efficacy of hypertension treatment. Recent findings: Animal studies indicate that blood pressure variability is as important as blood pressure level in determining end-organ damage, and that high blood pressure variability is associated with end-organ damage, including myocardial lesions, aortic hypertrophy, vascular remodeling and renal damage. Although the organ damage induced by high blood pressure variability was similar to that induced by hypertension, comparative studies in sinoaortic-denervated and spontaneously hypertensive rats revealed that aortic hypertrophy is a sensitive index of high blood pressure variability, and left ventricular hypertrophy is a sensitive index of high blood pressure level. The possible mechanisms for high blood pressure variability-induced end-organ damage include: direct endothelial lesions, renin-angiotensin system activation, inflammation initiation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis augmentation. Blood pressure variability reduction contributes importantly to the organ-protective effect of some antihypertensive drugs. Summary: Although animal studies suggest some advantages in blood pressure variability measurements, clinical trials are necessary before the widespread use of blood pressure variability as a predictor of hypertensive organ damage and a new strategy for the treatment of hypertension."
247,"State-specific trends in self-reported blood pressure screening and high blood pressure--United States, 1991-1999.","High blood pressure (HBP) increases the risk for heart disease and stroke, the first and third leading causes of death in the United States, respectively. An estimated one in four U.S. adults has HBP, which is defined as taking antihypertensive medication or having either a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of > or = 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of > or = 90 mmHg. Optimal blood pressure is defined as SBP of < or = 120 mmHg or DBP of < or = 80 mmHg. To reduce the prevalence of HBP in the United States, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute initiated the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) in 1972, recommending that all adults aged > or = 20 years have their blood pressure (BP) checked at least once every 2 years. Although HBP is easily detectable and can usually be controlled with treatment, greater awareness of BP levels among U.S. adults is needed. This report summarizes data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) on state-specific trends in recent BP screening and prevalence of HBP (both by self-report). The findings indicate that during 1991-1999, BP screening levels were very high, and the percent of adults reporting HBP increased among some populations. Innovative education and intervention programs are needed to prevent and treat HBP in five high-risk groups: men, blacks, Hispanics, persons with less education, and older adults."
248,Is high blood pressure an aetiological factor in epistaxis?,"In the present investigation, 391 men born in 1913 were examined. The blood pressure was registered in a standardized way and the subjects were questioned about epistaxis. The aim of the investigation was to analyze whether habitual nose-bleeders or subjects with recent bleedings had higher blood pressure than the other subjects in the population study. All attempts to find a correlation between epistaxis and elevated (or high) blood pressure were unsuccessful. When high blood pressure is found in a patient with nose-bleeds it is probably an incidental finding and not an aetiological factor."

250,Racial differences in hypertension: implications for high blood pressure management.,"The racial disparity in hypertension and hypertension-related outcomes has been recognized for decades with African Americans with greater risks than Caucasians. Blood pressure levels have consistently been higher for African Americans with an earlier onset of hypertension. Although awareness and treatment levels of high blood pressure have been similar, racial differences in control rates are evident. The higher blood pressure levels for African Americans are associated with higher rates of stroke, end-stage renal disease and congestive heart failure. The reasons for the racial disparities in elevated blood pressure and hypertension-related outcomes risk remain unclear. However, the implications of the disparities of hypertension for prevention and clinical management are substantial, identifying African American men and women with excel hypertension risk and warranting interventions focused on these differences. In addition, focused research to identify the factors attributed to these disparities in risk burden is an essential need to address the evidence gaps."
251,Risk factors associated with newly diagnosed high blood pressure in men and women.,"Background: Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Early diagnosis and prevention of hypertension are of great importance in reducing overall mortality. The objective was to determine which potential risk factors are associated with newly diagnosed high blood pressure in women and men. Methods: This study is part of a population-based, cross-sectional study including 4,228 women and men aged 60 years in Stockholm County, Sweden. Newly diagnosed high blood pressure was defined as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure exceeding 140/90 measured on one occasion. Subjects with known hypertension were excluded, leaving 3,156 individuals. Results: Waist circumference > or =95 cm (quintiles 3-5) in men and > or =88.5 cm (quintiles 4-5) in women was associated with newly diagnosed high blood pressure. Secondary school was a protective factor in men (odds ratio (OR), men = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.99) and university education was protective in both men (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.52-0.85) and women (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.34-0.59). Regular physical activity was negatively associated in women (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.61-0.99), and high alcohol consumption (>30 g/day) was positively associated in men (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.22-2.09). Women were negatively associated with newly diagnosed high blood pressure (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.41-0.61). An interaction between college/university and gender was found in multivariate analysis (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.47-0.97). Conclusion: Gender differences in risk profile for newly diagnosed high blood pressure might explain part of the differences in hypertension found between men and women. These findings should be considered when planning preventive actions against hypertension at the community level."
252,"[Prevalence of high blood pressure and associated factors in students from public schools in Greater Metropolitan Recife, Pernambuco State, Brazil, 2006].","The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of systemic arterial hypertension (high blood pressure) and associated health factors in adolescents, using a cross-sectional, population-based, epidemiological design from April to September 2006, within a stratified sample according to school size and shift. Using the Portuguese version of the Global School-Based Student Health Survey questionnaire, 1,878 students from 29 public schools in Greater Metropolitan Recife, Pernambuco State, Brazil, were analyzed for: age, gender, body mass index, fruit, vegetable, alcohol, and tobacco consumption, as well as blood pressure, adopting the 1996 Task Force Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention parameters for nutritional status. Prevalence rates for high blood pressure, overweight, and obesity were 17.3%, 6.9%, and 3.7%, respectively. Factors associated with high blood pressure were: male gender, obesity, overweight, and lack of physical activity. Knowledge of factors associated with arterial hypertension in adolescents can help support health education campaigns."
253,Ambulatory blood pressure measurements in children and young adults selected by high and low casual blood pressure levels and parental history of hypertension: the Bogalusa Heart Study.,"Ambulatory blood pressure measurements were obtained in 57 children and young adults selected by prior high or low casual blood pressure levels and parental history of hypertension. Considerable variation in blood pressure levels occurred over 24 hours, with generally higher levels occurring in those so selected. Parental history had a small influence on higher levels, although statistical significance was not shown. Persons with higher blood pressure levels did not reach levels as low during sleep, especially with regard to the systolic measurement, and a greater variability was noted in those selected for higher levels. Although differentiation of persons with high and low blood pressure levels can be obtained by noting average levels persisting above a cut point, for example, 140/85, in growing children an arbitrary 90th percentile based on age, height, and weight may be more appropriate. Ambulatory monitoring showed that young persons, selected by casual measurements as having high blood pressure, have a greater percentage of high levels persisting over a 24-hour period, comprising a greater blood pressure load. These observations also showed that even two series of casual measurements may misclassify a person as having hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will enhance understanding of the early natural history of hypertension and allow improved prevention of the disease."
254,Nonpharmacologic therapies that reduce blood pressure: a fresh perspective.,"Traditional approaches to control the epidemic of blood pressure-related atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) have largely focused on drug therapy in persons with hypertension. Still, nonpharmacologic therapy, also termed lifestyle modification, has an important and expanding role that complements drug therapy. Specifically, nonpharmacologic therapies can serve as initial therapy in Stage 1 hypertensive patients, facilitate medication step down or withdrawal in patients with well-controlled hypertension, prevent hypertension in high-risk populations, and reduce blood pressure in normotensive individuals and thereby lower their risk of ASCVD. Traditional lifestyle modifications that reduce blood pressure include sodium reduction, weight loss, moderation of alcohol intake, and increased physical activity. Such strategies have been prominently advocated in the Fifth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Recommendations to increase potassium, magnesium, and calcium intake were based primarily on general health considerations, not for control of high blood pressure. In its sixth and most recent report (JNC VI) published in 1997, the Joint National Committee has extended its recommendations. In addition to the traditional lifestyle recommendations, the JNC VI advocates increased potassium intake for control of high blood pressure. Furthermore, this policy-making body now recommends a healthy dietary pattern, that is, one that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and reduced in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol. This diet, which was rigorously evaluated in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) clinical trial, substantially lowered blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive individuals. These recent developments reinforce the hypothesis that multiple dietary factors influence blood pressure. Nonpharmacologic approaches have enormous potential as a means to reduce blood pressure and control hypertension, thereby preventing the occurrence of ASCVD. The current challenge to health care providers, government officials, and the general public is to develop and implement effective clinical and public health strategies that lead to desirable lifestyle modifications."
255,Symptomology of Elevated Blood Pressure in Black Women with Hypertension.,"Understanding factors that influence hypertension self-management may improve blood pressure control in Black women; however, little is known about Black women's perceptions of symptoms associated with hypertension. In this study, using the revised version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R), we examined Black women's perceptions of symptoms that they associate with hypertension. While over half (52.5%) reported no symptoms of high blood pressure, 41.3% of the women reported one to six symptoms they attributed to high blood pressure. This study has the potential to increase clinicians' understanding of patients' perceptions of the symptomology of hypertension."
256,Factors associated with lack of awareness and uncontrolled high blood pressure among Canadian adults with hypertension.,"Background: Approximately 17% of Canadians with high blood pressure were unaware of their condition, and of Canadians aware of having the condition, approximately 1 in 5 have uncontrolled high blood pressure despite high rates of pharmacotherapy. The objectives of the current study are to estimate the prevalence of resistant hypertension and examine factors associated with (1) lack of awareness and (2) uncontrolled hypertension despite pharmacotherapy. Methods: Using the 2007-2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey (N = 3473, aged 20-79 years) and logistic regression, we quantified relationships between characteristics and (1) presence of hypertension, (2) lack of awareness (among those with hypertension), and (3) uncontrolled high blood pressure (among those treated for hypertension). Results: Older age, lowest income, and less than high school education were associated with presence of hypertension. Men (odds ratio [OR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.2) and adults < 60 years (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6) were more likely than others to be unaware. Among those aged 60+ years, women were more likely than men to have uncontrolled high blood pressure (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.2) despite treatment. Elevated systolic blood pressure was the issue in over 90% of women and 80% of men with uncontrolled hypertension. Depending on the definition employed, 4.4% (95% CI, 2.4-6.4) to 7.8% (95% CI, 6.0-9.6) of the population with hypertension had resistant hypertension. Conclusions: Messaging or interventions encouraging screening may be helpful for all younger Canadian adults and men; programs encouraging blood pressure control may help older women."
257,Employment status and high blood pressure in women: variations by time and by sociodemographic characteristics.,"Purpose: The association between employment status and high blood pressure in women was examined at two time periods to determine if associations between employment status and high blood pressure varied by time period or by age, race, education, marital status, or parental status. Methods: Women participants from the National Health Examination Survey (1960) and the Second National Health and Nutrition Survey (1976-1980) between the ages of 25 and 64 and currently employed or keeping house were included. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the cross-sectional association between employment status and high blood pressure in each survey, taking into account potential effect modifiers and covariates. Results: In 1960 employment was associated with a slight, but not statistically significant, elevation in odds of high blood pressure. In 1976-1980, it was associated with a modest but significant reduction in odds of high blood pressure. Variations in associations occurred by marital status (protective associations were limited to unmarried women) and race (associations were of stronger magnitude among African-American women). Conclusions: The employment status-high blood pressure relationship shifted across surveys. Changes in the composition of the employed and nonemployed groups account for at least part of the varying relationships."
258,Psychometric evaluation of the Polish adaptation of the Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy Scale.,"Background: Development of simple instruments for the determination of the level of adherence in patients with high blood pressure is the subject of ongoing research. One such instrument, gaining growing popularity worldwide, is the Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy. The aim of this study was to adapt and to test the reliability of the Polish version of Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy Scale. Methods: A standard guideline was used for the translation and cultural adaptation of the English version of the Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy Scale into Polish. The study included 117 Polish patients with hypertension aged between 27 and 90 years, among them 53 men and 64 women. Cronbach's alpha was used for analysing the internal consistency of the scale. Results: The mean score in the reduced sodium intake subscale was M = 5.7 points (standard deviation SD = 1.6 points). The mean score in the appointment-keeping subscale was M = 3.4 points (standard deviation SD = 1.4 points). The mean score in the medication-taking subscale was M = 11.6 points (standard deviation SD = 3.3 points). In the principal component analysis, the three-factor system (1 - medication-taking, 2 - appointment-keeping, 3 - reduced sodium intake) accounted for 53 % of total variance. All questions had factor loadings > 0.4. The medication-taking subscale: most questions (6 out of 9) had the highest loadings with Factor 1. The appointment-keeping subscale: all questions (2 out of 2) had the highest loadings with Factor 2. The reduced sodium intake subscale: most questions (2 out of 3) had the highest loadings with Factor 3. Goodness of fit was tested at chi(2) = 248.87; p < 0.001. The Cronbach's alpha score for the entire questionnaire was 0.851. Conclusion: The Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy Scale proved to be suitable for use in the Polish population. Use of this screening tool for the assessment of adherence to BP treatment is recommended."
259,Screening for high blood pressure: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement.,Description: Reaffirmation of the 2003 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force statement about screening for high blood pressure. Methods: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force did a targeted literature search for evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for high blood pressure. Recommendation: Screen for high blood pressure in adults age 18 years or older. (Grade A recommendation).
260,New oral salt in treatment of high blood pressure.,"The roles of sodium, potassium and magnesium in the etiology of high blood pressure are reviewed. Mechanisms of action for these cations in alterations of systemic blood pressure are discussed. A rationale for the introduction of a new Na-K-Mg salt for the prevention and treatment of hypertension in human subjects is presented. Preliminary results with this new Na-K-Mg salt are promising."
261,"Exploring the relationship of peripheral total bilirubin, red blood cell, and hemoglobin with blood pressure during childhood and adolescence.","Objective: Total bilirubin is beneficial for protecting cardiovascular diseases in adults. The authors aimed to investigate the association of total bilirubin, red blood cell, and hemoglobin levels with the prevalence of high blood pressure in children and adolescents. Methods: A total of 3776 students (aged from 6 to 16 years old) were examined using cluster sampling. Pre-high blood pressure and high blood pressure were respectively defined as the point of 90th and 95th percentiles based on the Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were standardized into z-scores. Results: Peripheral total bilirubin, red blood cell and hemoglobin levels were significantly correlated with age, and also varied with gender. Peripheral total bilirubin was negatively correlated with systolic blood pressure in 6- and 9-year-old boys, whilst positively correlated with diastolic blood pressure in the 12-year-old boys and 13- to 15-year-old girls (p<0.05). Higher levels of red blood cell and hemoglobin were observed in pre-high blood pressure and high blood pressure students when compared with their normotensive peers (p<0.01). The increases in red blood cell and hemoglobin were significantly associated with high blood pressure after adjusting for confounding factors. The ORs (95% CI) of each of the increases were 2.44 (1.52-3.92) and 1.04 (1.03-1.06), respectively. No statistical association between total bilirubin and high blood pressure was observed (p>0.05). Conclusion: Total bilirubin could be weakly correlated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as correlations varied with age and gender in children and adolescents; in turn, the increased levels of red blood cell and hemoglobin are proposed to be positively associated with the prevalence of high blood pressure."
262,An historical and critical review of the articles on blood pressure published in Psychosomatic Medicine between 1939 and 1997.,"Between 1939 and 1997, there have been 59 volumes of Psychosomatic Medicine. Over this period there were 200 articles dealing with blood pressure. About 90% of these were concerned with high blood pressure. This article reviews all of these papers both from an historical perspective and critically. Although there has been a significant growth in the rate of articles published since 1939, there has always been a strong interest in the nature of hypertension, particularly the roles of affects and emotions in the natural history of the disease. For example, volume 1, number 1 of the Journal includes a symposium on high blood pressure in which Franz Alexander stated his well-known hypothesis that the chronic inhibition of rage plays a causal role in the production of hypertension. In various forms, the notion that anger is an important mediator of hypertension has neither been proved nor abandoned. One major conclusion drawn from this review is that the current research on high blood pressure is drifting somewhat aimlessly. It has become preoccupied with demonstrations that various stimuli or situations (usually characterized as stresses) can acutely raise blood pressure. Despite this focus, neither the necessary nor the sufficient conditions for labeling a stimulus as stress has ever been agreed upon. Likewise, there have been many demonstrations of an iatrogenic effect on blood pressure, but neither the behavioral mechanisms underlying this effect nor the strategies for eliminating it have been explicated. Finally, this article identifies several areas where it would be useful to review and integrate current knowledge. Hopefully, such integrations could play a significant role in focusing and shaping future research and clinical practice."
263,"Time Trends of High Blood Pressure Prevalence, Awareness and Control in the Italian General Population : Surveys of the National Institute of Health.","Introduction: High blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The urgency of the problem was underlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Action Plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, which recommends a 25% relative reduction in the prevalence of raised BP by 2020. A surveillance system represents a useful tool to monitor BP in the general population. Since 1980s, the National Institute of Health has conducted several surveys of the adult general population, measuring cardiovascular risk factors by standardized procedures and methods. Aim: To describe mean BP levels and high BP prevalence from 1978 to 2012 by sex and quinquennia of age. Methods: Data were derived from the following three studies: (i) Risk Factors and Life Expectancy (RIFLE), conducted between 1978 and 2002 in 13 Italian regions (>70,000 persons); (ii) Osservatorio Epidemiologico Cardiovascolare (OEC), conducted between 1998-2002 in the general population from all Italian regions (>9000 persons); and (iii) Osservatorio Epidemiologico Cardiovascolare/Health Examination Survey (OEC/HES), conducted between 2008-2012 in the general population from all Italian regions (>9000 persons). Results: A significant decrease in mean systolic and diastolic BP levels and prevalence of high BP from 1978 to 2012 was observed both in men and women. BP and high BP increased by age classes in all considered periods. BP awareness and control also improved. Conclusion: Our data suggest that BP control could be achieved by 2020, as recommended by WHO."
264,Why lowering blood pressure is not enough: the hypertension syndrome and the clinical context of cardiovascular risk reduction.,"Although drug treatment for hypertension has been widely used for many years, overall control of this disease continues to be less than optimal. Hypertension treatment has had a positive impact on stroke rates, but rates of coronary heart disease remain high. One reason for this lack of success in treatment is that physicians have focused too narrowly on lowering blood pressure. Blood pressure is a critical element of hypertension, but many other interrelated risk factors contribute to form a complex syndrome of hypertension. Studies show that young adult subjects who do not yet have high blood pressure but do have a family history of hypertension exhibit increased incidence of other risk factors, such as high cholesterol, left ventricular dysfunction, reduced arterial compliance, and insulin resistance. These patients with ""normotensive hypertension"" share many characteristics with patients with fully developed hypertension, both uncontrolled and controlled. The link between these many risk factors and high blood pressure seems to lie in endothelial cell balance. If this balance is upset, elements of the hypertension syndrome start to become manifest, often before blood pressure becomes elevated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can restore this critical balance, improving overall arterial health and arterial compliance and thus preventing the progression of the hypertension syndrome to high blood pressure and, ultimately, target organ damage."
265,A comparison of compliance techniques on the control of high blood pressure.,"Four compliance strategies were compared with education alone to investigate their impact on the control of high blood pressure. One hundred twelve subjects with documented high blood pressure were randomly assigned to receive education alone, home blood pressure monitoring, contracts, pill packs, or a combination of techniques. Groups were similar in terms of age, sex, race, initial blood pressure, and medications. At the end of the year, there was no significant change in blood pressure for the group that received education alone (-3/-1 mm Hg). There was a statistically significant change in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure for all compliance groups (-17/-10 mm Hg). Information from compliance questionnaires adds further support to the observation that education alone does not influence compliance while the specific techniques studied did improve compliance. The study was too small to show any difference among techniques."
266,Management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents: recommendations of the European Society of Hypertension.,"Hypertension in children and adolescents has gained ground in cardiovascular medicine, thanks to the progress made in several areas of pathophysiological and clinical research. These guidelines represent a consensus among specialists involved in the detection and control of high blood pressure in children and adolescents. The guidelines synthesize a considerable amount of scientific data and clinical experience and represent best clinical wisdom upon which physicians, nurses and families should base their decisions. They call attention to the burden of hypertension in children and adolescents, and its contribution to the current epidemic of cardiovascular disease, these guidelines should encourage public policy makers, to develop a global effort to improve identification and treatment of high blood pressure among children and adolescents."
267,"Recent trends in the prevalence of high blood pressure and its treatment and control, 1999-2008.","High blood pressure is one of the most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke (1). This report evaluates the overall trends in age-adjusted high blood pressure prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control using the most recent 10 year NHANES data. It also examines these age-adjusted rates for hypertension by sex, age, and race and ethnicity."
268,Blood pressure in children with renal cysts and diabetes syndrome.,"Cystic kidney diseases such as autosomal recessive or dominant polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD and ADPKD) are associated with high prevalence of arterial hypertension. On the contrary, studies on hypertension in children with renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome caused by abnormalities in the HNF1B gene are rare. Therefore, the primary aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of high blood pressure in children with RCAD syndrome due to HNF1B gene abnormalities and secondary to search for possible risk factors for development of high blood pressure. Data on all children with genetically proven RCAD syndrome from three pediatric nephrology tertiary centers were retrospectively reviewed (office blood pressure (BP), ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), creatinine clearance, renal ultrasound, echocardiography, albuminuria/proteinuria). High blood pressure was defined as BP ≥ 95th percentile of the current ESH 2016 guidelines and/or by the use of antihypertensive drugs. Thirty-two children with RCAD syndrome were investigated. Three children received ACE inhibitors for hypertension and/or proteinuria. High blood pressure was diagnosed using office BP in 22% of the children (n = 7). In the 7 performed ABPM, 1 child (14%) was diagnosed with hypertension and one child with white-coat hypertension. Creatinine clearance, proteinuria, albuminuria, body mass index, enlargement, or hypodysplasia of the kidneys and prevalence of HNF1B-gene deletion or mutation were not significantly different between hypertensive and normotensive children.Conclusion: High blood pressure is present in 22% of children with RCAD syndrome. What is Known: • Arterial hypertension is a common complication in children with polycystic kidney diseases. What is New: • High office blood pressure is present in 22% and ambulatory hypertension in 14% of children with renal cyst and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome."
269,"Differential impact of systolic and diastolic blood pressure level on JNC-VI staging. Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.","The sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure classifies blood pressure into stages on the basis of both systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure levels. When a disparity exists between SBP and DBP stages, patients are classified into the higher stage (""up-staged""). We evaluated the effect of disparate levels of SBP and DBP on blood pressure staging and eligibility for therapy. We examined 4962 Framingham Heart Study subjects between 1990 and 1995 and determined blood pressure stages on the basis of SBP alone, DBP alone, or both. After the exclusion of subjects on antihypertensive therapy (n=1306), 3656 subjects (mean age 58+/-13 years; 55% women) were eligible. In this sample, 64.6% of subjects had congruent stages of SBP and DBP, 31.6% were up-staged on the basis of SBP, and 3.8% on the basis of DBP; thus, SBP alone correctly classified JNC-VI stage in approximately 96% (64.6%+31.6%) of the subjects. Among subjects >60 years of age, SBP alone correctly classified 99% of subjects; in those </=60 years old, SBP alone correctly classified 95%. Of 1488 subjects with high-normal blood pressure or hypertension, who were potentially eligible for drug therapy, 13.0% had congruent elevations of SBP and DBP, 77.7% were up-staged on the basis of SBP, and 9.3% were up-staged on the basis of DBP; SBP alone correctly classified 91%, whereas DBP alone correctly classified only 22%. SBP elevation out of proportion to DBP is common in middle-aged and older persons. SBP appears to play a greater role in the determination of JNC-VI blood pressure stage and eligibility for therapy. Given these results, combined with evidence from hypertension treatment trials, future guidelines might consider a greater role for SBP than for DBP in determining the presence of hypertension, risk of cardiovascular events, eligibility for therapy, and benefits of treatment."
270,Blood pressure studies in paediatric populations: metabolic syndrome in hypertensive children and adolescents.,"The purpose of this paper is to outline our studies and observations regarding the prevalence of high blood pressure values in paediatric and juvenile populations, the early response of the left ventricle (left ventricular mass and septal and parietal wall thickness) to elevated blood pressure, the presence of a metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents with high blood pressure values, and the influence of this latter finding in the management and treatment of paediatric and juvenile hypertension."
271,High blood pressure diagnosis and treatment: consensus recommendations vs actual practice.,"Diagnostic and treatment practices of institutional facilities treating high blood pressure in New York City were surveyed by mail in 1978. Respondents were adhering to the treatment recommendations of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Ninety-two per cent of respondents reported 90-104 mm Hg as the diastolic blood pressure level at which drug therapy was initiated, indicating a more aggressive approach than was warranted by the information available at the time of the survey."
272,[Hypertensive retinopathy--assessment].,"The authors intend to make a synthesis of several recent studies available on the Internet regarding hypertensive retinopathy. From the physiopathologic point of view, it is considered that the blood circulation at the level of the retina, choroid and optical nerve has distinct anatomo-physiological properties. It has a different response to the changes in the blood pressure, the result consisting of distinct individual types of the hypertensive disease which can be rendered evident during the optical fundus examination. The retina is considered to be one of the target organs in the hypertensive disease. Ascertaining the retinal changes has advanced from ophthalmoscopy to digital photography studied with appropriate software. The assessment of the hypertensive microangiopathy is subjected to a wide intra- and interobserver variability an accurate assessment requiring specialized software and standardized protocols. There is also a lack of consensus regarding the classification of hypertensive retinopathy and the usefulness of retinal examination in the assessment of cardiovascular risk. The Keith and Scheie staging scales are still in use, but they do not allow the clinician to differentiate slight or even moderate changes at the level of the retina of hypertensive patients. Furthermore, they do not correlate enough with the severity of the high blood pressure and they are not supported by the angiofluorography studies. There are not enough motives for the recommendation of a routine ophthalmoscopic examination for all hypertensive patients. It is required for patients with stage-3 hypertension. It is also recommended when the initial clinical signs are equivocal, as in borderline or fluctuating high blood pressure without any other obvious signs from the target organs, for diabetic patients, or in the presence of visual symptoms. The clinical implications of hypertensive retinopathy being unclear, many of the authors do not recommend ophthalmoscopic examination as a rule, or they don't consider the retinal signs as being useful for therapeutic decisions."
273,Blood pressure control in private practice: a case report.,"High blood pressure is most commonly treated in the offices of private physicians. We have attempted to evaluate the efficacy of such care through review of all patient charts of a Board Certified, University Medical Center affiliated internist in New York City. Seventeen per cent had elevated (greater than or equal to 160/95) blood pressures or were taking antihypertensive medication at the time of their last visit. A selected group of 206 charts was examined to determine attendance and blood pressure outcome. Over one-half of these patients were lost to follow-up within a year of their initial visit. Of those who persisted in therapy, 55 per cent achieved good blood pressure control. Blood pressure outcomes among medicated patients were not different from those of patients who received no prescription. These results suggest that this conventional pattern of ambulatory medical care, characterized by a high attrition rate and a failure to adequately control blood pressure, may not be suitable to the long-term management of high blood pressure."
274,Controversies and problems of volume control and hypertension in haemodialysis.,"Extracellular volume overload and hypertension are important contributors to the high risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients undergoing haemodialysis. Hypertension is present in more than 90% of patients at the initiation of haemodialysis and persists in more than two-thirds, despite use of several antihypertensive medications. High blood pressure is a risk factor for the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and mortality, although there are controversies with some study findings showing poor survival with low-but not high-blood pressure. The most frequent cause of hypertension in patients undergoing haemodialysis is volume overload, which is associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes itself independent of blood pressure. Although antihypertensive medications might not be successful to control blood pressure, extracellular volume reduction by persistent ultrafiltration and dietary salt restriction can produce favourable results with good blood pressure control. More frequent or longer haemodialysis can facilitate volume and blood pressure control. However, successful volume and blood pressure control is also possible in patients undergoing conventional haemodialysis."
275,[CLINIC BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING AS A PREDICTOR OF MASKED HYPERTENSION].,"Introduction: Masked hypertension is strongly linked to morbidity and mortality. The phenomenon poses a challenge to physicians due to the difficult diagnosis. Recent studies have shown that the incidence may occur in 8.8% -16.6% of the population and up to 30.4% among people with borderline blood pressure. Objectives: To examine the prevalence of masked hypertension in the Israeli population and the clinic blood pressure status as a predictor of masked hypertension. Methods: Interviewees were randomly recruited from among passers-by at Assuta Hospital in Ashdod. Those who were found to have normal and normal-high blood pressure ranges were included in the study. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed, and anthropometric measures were assessed. A statistical analysis compared groups according to their blood pressure clinical and ambulatory blood pressure categories. Results: A total of 35 participants were included in this research. Masked hypertension was found among 35.3% of patients with normal range blood pressure and 27.7% of those in the borderline range. Significant differences were found between the normotensive group and the masked hypertension group in BMI, waist circumference, and clinical category of clinic diastolic blood pressure. Conclusions: A third of those with in-clinic normal blood pressure suffer from masked hypertension. Borderline in-clinic diastolic blood pressure is significantly associated with masked hypertension. Discussion: This study presents higher masked hypertension rates than previously reported, the difference may be explained by differences in the nature and the lifestyle of the study population. The high incidence of the phenomenon indicates the need for further investigation of patients with in-clinic normal and borderline blood pressure."
276,Determinants of control of high blood pressure. The Oslo Health Study 2000-2001.,"Objective: To examine determinants of control of high blood pressure in Oslo, Norway. Methods: The Oslo Health Study 2000-2001, a population-based survey, included 6301 men and 7645 women born in 1924/25, 1940/41, 1955 and 1960 that were screened for high blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors. Uncontrolled high blood pressure was defined as systolic > 140 mmHg or diastolic > 90 mmHg or both. Results: Use of antihypertensive drugs was 4.1% at age 40-45 years, 19.1% at age 60 years and 35.8% at age 75 years. Among pharmacologically treated subjects with diabetes or cardiovascular disease (CVD), one-third of subjects aged 40-45 years, over one-half of those aged 60 years and nearly two-thirds of those aged 75 years had uncontrolled high blood pressure. These proportions were 8-13 percentage points higher in subjects without diabetes or CVD. Among pharmacologically treated men, younger age, use of statins, body mass index below 25 kg/m2, and CVD or diabetes were associated with a lower risk of uncontrolled high blood pressure. Among treated women, younger age and cigarette smoking were associated with a lower risk (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The presence of CVD or diabetes and the prescription of cholesterol-lowering statins were independently associated with better control of blood pressure. Non-smoking women were more likely to have uncontrolled high blood pressure than their smoking counterparts."
277,Predictors of blood pressure and hypertension. General principles.,"Early intervention in the treatment of hypertension can reduce the detrimental effects of high blood pressure. Therefore it is important to be able to predict the development of hypertension in individuals. A number of factors can be used as predictors of hypertension, but only childhood high blood pressure (especially in combination with obesity) is a potent predictor of future hypertension. A family history of hypertension is a contributory risk factor, as is tachycardia, but neither is as strong a predictor as a youthful elevated pressure."
278,The Burden of Modifiable Risk Factors in Newly Defined Categories of Blood Pressure.,"Background: The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline introduced new categories of high blood pressure. The vast majority of individuals in these newly defined categories are recommended for nonpharmacological intervention rather than antihypertensive therapy. This study sought to determine the burden of potentially modifiable risk factors of hypertension among untreated adults in the newly defined categories of blood pressure. Methods: We analyzed data from the 1999-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 37,448). Potentially modifiable risk factors included abdominal obesity, high non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, secondhand smoking, binge drinking, suboptimal physical activity, and low-fiber diet. Results: Although the prevalence of certain modifiable risk factors decreased during the study period, the prevalence of low fiber intake, suboptimal physical activity, abdominal obesity, and binge drinking remained high during the last combined survey cycle (2011-2014). Modifiable risk factors generally demonstrated dose-response relationships with high blood pressure categories. The most common type of risk factor clustering included low fiber intake, suboptimal physical activity, high non-HDL cholesterol, and abdominal obesity, with its prevalence increasing gradually from 9.5% (95% confidence interval, 8.8%-10.3%) in the normal blood pressure group to 16.5% (95% confidence interval, 14.8%-18.3%) in the stage 2 hypertension group (Ptrend < .001). The prevalence of 4 or more modifiable risk factors per participant increased stepwise, ranging from 28.5% in the normal blood pressure group to 48.0% in the stage 2 hypertension group (Ptrend < .001). Conclusions: The burden of potentially modifiable risk factors for hypertension shows progressive increase along the blood pressure categories and represents an important target for nonpharmacologic intervention."
279,[High blood pressure care: beyond the clinical setting].,"The recommendations from the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) were compared with those of a recent article by Aram V. Chobanian, Chairman of the JNC 7. The purpose was to identify the changes that this author proposed and determine how they might affect clinical work, as well as the health services and public health implications. The JNC 7 and the article in question coincide on all essential points, except that the article is more flexible when it comes to the use of diuretics at the start of treatment for high blood pressure. Chronic disease management should take place in health systems with primary care approach, where the epidemiology of such diseases and scientific advances in prevention offer an excellent opportunity for redesigning the health services and making them more effective. High blood pressure, as a public health problem, demands health interventions aimed not only at reducing harm but modifying its etiologic determinants. The challenge is to recognize that an integrated approach to clinical medicine, health services, and public health would offer an attractive opportunity to interrupt and prevent the continuous and costly vicious circle that managing high blood pressure and its complications implies."
280,The new blood pressure guidelines: a digest.,"Background: In December 2003, the National High Blood Pressure Education Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute finalized the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, called JNC 7. Overview and conclusions: On the basis of new trials and observational studies, and the need for clear and concise guidelines, the JNC implemented changes in blood pressure classification, nomenclature, treatment and prevention in the JNC 7 report. One of the key messages of the report is that systolic blood pressure higher than 140 millimeters of mercury in people older than 50 years of age is a more important risk factor than diastolic blood pressure. Another finding is that people with normal blood pressure at the age of 55 to 65 years have an 80 to 90 percent risk of developing hypertension by the age of 80 to 85 years. Clinical implications: JNC 7 emphasizes that health care professionals besides physicians, including dentists, need to help patients by reinforcing hypertension-related lifestyle modifications, pharmacological therapies and adherence to treatment."
281,Mechanisms contributing to high blood pressure.,"Essential hypertension, a disease that affects about 60 million Americans, is not a homogeneous clinical entity. The disease is caused by altered regulation of mechanisms that control arterial pressure. Because the manifestations of the abnormally regulated pressure have many factors, the approaches to treatment likewise may be expected to be multifactorial. Hemodynamic, neural and catecholamine, renopressor, renal excretory and volume, hormonal, electrolyte, and depressor mechanisms are discussed. Associated conditions that must be considered include exogenous obesity, hyperuricemia, coronary artery disease, carbohydrate intolerance, and hyperlipidemia. Clearer understanding of the role of each of these factors in essential hypertension should provide a rationale for wise selection of antihypertensive therapy and allow reversal of the very high rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with the disease."
282,Salt and hypertension.,"Studies comparing different communities have suggested that the amount of salt in the diet may play an important role in determining blood pressure levels within a particular community. Intervention studies have also suggested that salt intake may play an important role in determining blood pressure levels in man. In animals, where more clearcut experiments can be done, an increase in salt intake both in inherited forms of hypertension and experimental hypertension causes a further rise in blood pressure. Recent work has suggested that this rise in blood pressure could be related to an inherited or imposed defect in the kidney's ability to excrete sodium, which will give rise to greater compensatory mechanisms to overcome the sodium retention. These compensatory mechanisms might eventually be responsible for the development of high blood pressure. In patients who have already developed high blood pressure, restricting the amount of salt in the diet does cause a fall in blood pressure in many patients. However, short-term reduction of salt intake in normotensive subjects causes little, if any, fall in blood pressure. The effectiveness of short term salt restriction in lowering blood pressure in adults therefore appears to be related to the severity of the high blood pressure and, probably more directly, to the suppression of the renin system that occurs as blood pressure rises."
283,Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.,"The National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy has defined four categories of hypertension in pregnancy: chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. A maternal blood pressure measurement of 140/90 mm Hg or greater on two occasions before 20 weeks of gestation indicates chronic hypertension. Pharmacologic treatment is needed to prevent maternal end-organ damage from severely elevated blood pressure (150 to 180/100 to 110 mm Hg); treatment of mild to moderate chronic hypertension does not improve neonatal outcomes or prevent superimposed preeclampsia. Gestational hypertension is a provisional diagnosis for women with new-onset, nonproteinuric hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation; many of these women are eventually diagnosed with preeclampsia or chronic hypertension. Preeclampsia is the development of new-onset hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Adverse pregnancy outcomes related to severe preeclampsia are caused primarily by the need for preterm delivery. HELLP (i.e., hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome is a form of severe preeclampsia with high rates of neonatal and maternal morbidity. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice to prevent and treat eclampsia. The use of magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis in women with mild preeclampsia is controversial because of the low incidence of seizures in this population."
284,Lay beliefs about high blood pressure in a low- to middle-income urban African-American community: an opportunity for improving hypertension control.,"Purpose: Lay beliefs about illness are a potential barrier to improving the control of hypertension. We investigated the extent to which lay beliefs about hypertension diverge from current medical understanding. Methods: We conducted street intercept interviews and focus group discussions in six predominantly African-American census tracts in the southern sector of Dallas County, Texas. Sixty subjects, aged 18 to 67 years, were stopped along popular thoroughfares and administered a brief survey. Additionally, 107 participants were interviewed in 12 homogeneous focus groups, balanced by sex and age (18 to 74 years). Participants were asked about the meaning, causes, consequences, and treatment of high blood pressure. Results: The street intercept data indicated that 35% (n = 21) of respondents related high blood pressure to eating pork or other foods that makes the blood travel too fast to the head, and only 15% (n = 9) related hypertension to an elevated pressure in blood vessels. The focus group data indicated that hypertension was causally linked to eating pork in 8 of the 12 groups; was perceived as a symptomatic illness in all 12 groups; and was considered treatable with vitamins, garlic, and other herbs in 11 groups, with prescription medications in 10 groups and with lifestyle modifications such as weight loss in 8 groups. Hypertension was mentioned as a leading cause of death among African Americans in none of the 4 focus groups of 18-year-old to 29-year-old participants, in 2 of the 4 focus groups of 30-year-old to 49-year-old participants, and in 3 of the 4 focus groups of 50-year-old to 74-year-old participants. Conclusions: In a low- to middle-income urban African-American community, the predominant beliefs about hypertension diverged sharply from current medical understanding. Lack of appreciation of these lay beliefs by providers may contribute to noncompliance and poor rates of hypertension control."
285,Update on the 1987 Task Force Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents: a working group report from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on Hypertension Control in Children and Adolescents.,"Background: The ""Report of the Second Task Force on Blood Pressure Control in Children-1987"" developed normative blood pressure (BP) data for children and adolescents. These normative data are used to classify BP levels. Since 1987, additional BP data in children and adolescents, the use of newer classes of drugs, and the role of primary prevention of hypertension have expanded the body of knowledge regarding the classification and treatment of hypertension in the young. Objective: To report new normative BP data in children and adolescents and to provide additional information regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of hypertension in children. Methods: A working group was appointed by the director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute as chair of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) Coordinating Committee. Data on children from the 1988 through 1991 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III and nine additional national data sets were combined to develop normative BP tables. The working group members produced initial draft documents that were reviewed by NHBPEP Coordinating Committee representatives as well as experts in pediatrics, cardiology, and hypertension. This reiterative process occurred for 12 draft documents. The NHBPEP Coordinating Committee discussed the report, and additional comments were received. Differences of opinion were adjudicated by the chair of the working group. The final report was sent to representatives of the 44 organizations on the NHBPEP Coordinating Committee for vote. It was approved unanimously by the NHBPEP Coordinating Committee on October 2, 1995. Conclusions: This report provides new normative BP tables for children and adolescents, which now include height percentiles, age, and gender. The fifth Korotkoff sound is now used to define diastolic BP in children and adolescents. New charts have been developed to guide practicing clinicians in antihypertensive drug therapy selection. The primary prevention of hypertension in these age groups is discussed. A statement on public health considerations in the treatment of children and adolescents is provided."
286,[Management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents: Recommendations of the European Society of hypertension].,"Hypertension in children and adolescents has been gaining ground in cardiovascular medicine, mainly due to the advances made in several areas of pathophysiological and clinical research. These guidelines arose from the consensus reached by specialists in the detection and control of hypertension in children and adolescents. Furthermore, these guidelines are a compendium of scientific data and the extensive clinical experience it contains represents the most complete information that doctors, nurses and families should take into account when making decisions. These guidelines, which stress the importance of hypertension in children and adolescents, and its contribution to the current epidemic of cardiovascular disease, should act as a stimulus for governments to develop a global effort for the early detection and suitable treatment of high pressure in children and adolescents. J Hypertens 27:1719-1742 Q 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."
287,[Hypertension and stress].,"Stress and adjustment to stress involve pathophysiological processes operating in the cardiovascular system, particularly concerning high blood pressure. Stress and high blood pressure are closely linked. Stress induces transient psychosomatic-related increases in blood pressure, but can also induce more permanent rise in blood pressure when associated with other environmental, psychological, or genetic risk factors. Symptomatic treatment of high blood pressure requires medicinal antihypertensive therapy; anti-stress therapy is an effective but not sufficient complement."
288,Laboratory assessment of the hypertensive individual. Value of the main guidelines for high blood pressure.,"Objective: To determine if abnormal laboratory findings are more common in individuals with hypertension and in those with other risk factors, such as obesity, smoking and alcohol ingestion. Methods: A study was carried out in the general outpatient clinics of a university hospital (145 individuals without previous diagnosis of hypertension) and the following variables were assessed: high blood pressure (as defined by the VI Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection and Treatment of High Blood Pressure--VI JNC), obesity [calculated using body mass index (BMI)], tobacco use, and alcoholic ingestion. The laboratory examinations consisted of the following tests: hemogram, glycemia, uric acid, potassium, total/HDL-fraction cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium and creatinine. Results: High blood pressure was not associated with a higher number of abnormal laboratory tests. Hypertensive individuals with a BMI > or = 25 kg/m2 or normotensive obese individuals, however, had a higher frequency of diabetes (12X), hypertriglyceridemia (3X), and hypercholesterolemia (2X), as compared with hypertensive individuals with BMI < 25 kg/m2 and preobese/normal weight normotensive individuals. Conclusion: High blood pressure is not associated with a higher frequency of abnormal laboratory tests. The association of high blood pressure and obesity, however, increases the detection of diabetes and dyslipidemias."
289,Maternal Gestational Diabetes Is Associated With Offspring's Hypertension.,"Objective: Several studies assessed maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with the risk of childhood high blood pressure, and the results were inconsistent. We investigated the association between maternal GDM and hypertension risk in offspring during early childhood. Methods: We performed a large study in 1,156 mother-child pairs (578 GDM and 578 non-GDM matched by their offspring's age and sex). Maternal GDM was diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria. Childhood height, weight, and blood pressure were measured using standardized methods. Age-, sex-, and height-specific blood pressure Z score, childhood hypertension, and high blood pressure were evaluated according to the reference range of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents. Results: After adjustment for maternal and children's characteristics, children born to mothers with GDM during pregnancy had higher mean values of systolic blood pressure Z score (0.09 vs. -0.17), and higher prevalence of hypertension (6.4% vs. 3.5%) and high blood pressure (15.6% vs. 9.3%) in comparison with their counterparts born to mothers without GDM during pregnancy (all P values <0.05). Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios among children of mothers with GDM compared with children of mothers without GDM were 2.32 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.16-4.62) for hypertension and 1.89 (95% CI 1.24-2.86) for high blood pressure, respectively. Conclusions: Maternal GDM was associated with an increased risk of hypertension in the offspring. Controlling maternal GDM may be important for preventing childhood hypertension in the affected offspring."
290,Hypertension in women.,"Hypertension in women has received less attention than hypertension in men, and the major controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy have been carried out in populations made up predominantly of and have emphasised outcomes in men. Recently it has been recognised that women develop high blood pressure, particularly systolic hypertension, at an increased rate as they age, and that this age-related blood pressure increase is exaggerated by the menopause. The age-related rise in blood pressure, particularly systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, contributes substantially to the age-related increase in risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke in middle-aged and elderly women. This article reviews aspects of hypertension epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment that are important to women's health with particular emphasis on important concomitant cardiovascular disease risk factors such as type 2 diabetes and the menopause. The role of ovarian hormones and their withdrawal in the pathogenesis of hypertension and related target organ damage is considered, as are the results of drug treatment of high blood pressure in women. Blood pressure in pregnancy is discussed in a separate article by Broughton-Pipkin and Roberts."
291,Living with high blood pressure.,"This study was undertaken to explore the experience of people taking long-term antihypertensive medication. The study contributes to the understanding health professionals have of people with high blood pressure and the antihypertensive treatments they receive. Consideration was given to the full life context of people taking long-term antihypertensive medication and the health/medical culture in which people find themselves. A qualitative method of inquiry generated the descriptive data. Nineteen participants (four men and 15 women) were interviewed once, of which 16 were interviewed a second time. Data analysis involved extraction of concepts which in turn were clustered into themes. An organizing framework was constructed to integrate the six themes and 18 sub-themes. The framework represents the individual's experience as a sequence, starting broadly in the social context of her/his life, and narrowing down to the particulars of personal routine and patterns referring to living with hypertension and it's medication regimens. The final theme refers to the broader context of the health culture. A vast range of experiences were described by participants taking long-term antihypertensive medication. This accentuates the necessity for health professionals to address the uniqueness of the individual, and consider the context of a person's life when prescribing and monitoring medications for people with high blood pressure."
292,Is there a role for nurse-led blood pressure management in primary care?,"Adequate treatment of high blood pressure reduces the risk of strokes and other cardiovascular events, but current treatment in UK general practice is often inadequate. Nurse-led management of people with high blood pressure could lead to improvements due to strict adherence to protocols, agreed target blood pressure, better prescribing and compliance, and regular follow-up. However, a review of the literature shows a lack of robust evidence of the effectiveness of nurse-led hypertension management in primary care. There is a clear need for randomized controlled trials to see if nurse-led management is associated with better blood pressure control than routine care."
293,Prediction of high blood pressure in young people: the limited usefulness of parental blood pressure data.,"Blood pressure was measured in 864 young people aged 16-24 years, 8 years after both of their parents had their blood pressures measured as part of the screening phase of the Medical Research Council Mild Hypertension Trial. Only 29% of offspring with a conventional 'family history of hypertension', defined in terms of having at least one parent with a score in the top 10% of the distribution, had a blood pressure score in the top 20% after 8 years. The positive predictive value was increased to 38% in offspring with two parents in the top 20%, but only 4% of offspring met this definition and only 7% of offspring in the top 20% after 8 years were identified by this method. Sensitivity was increased to 46% in offspring with at least one parent in the top 20%, but 33% of offspring met this definition and 74% of them did not have a blood pressure level in the top 20% after 8 years. It is concluded that parental blood pressure data are of limited value for the prediction of high blood pressure in young people and provide no scientific basis for a high risk strategy of prevention."
294,How far should blood pressure be reduced in diabetic hypertensive patients?,"EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DIABETES: Diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension are closely related diseases that strongly predispose an individual to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and to renal failure. High blood pressure is twice as frequent in diabetics compared with the general population, and often precedes and contributes to the development of diabetic nephropathy. The prevalence of coexisting arterial hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is increasing as populations age, giving an increased prevalence of both diseases. TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSIVE DIABETIC PATIENTS: The goal of treating arterial hypertension in diabetic patients is to prevent death and disability associated with high blood pressure. In addition, other reversible risk factors for cardiovascular disease, seen so frequently in hypertensive diabetics, also need to be addressed. The optimal goal of blood pressure control in diabetics has not been established, but there are indications that it should be lower than the 130/85 mmHg systolic/diastolic pressure recommended by current guidelines. In the presence of multiple associated risk factors, most guidelines suggest a threshold for intervention of > or = 140/90 mmHg. In particular, in hypertensive diabetic patients intervention must be early and aggressive."
295,"[Uncontrolled factors of blood pressure in essential hypertension: from ""patient's high blood pressure"" to ""hypertensive patient""].","Hypertension is a significant medical and public health issue which puts an enormous burden on health care resources and the community. It is a chronic medical condition in which the systemic arterial blood pressure (BP) is elevated. Serious complications including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases would be preventable if the rise in BP with age could be prevented or diminished. The majority of hypertensive patients require long-term treatment. Oral antihypertensive drugs, lifestyle modification including exercise and dietary modification are milestones for hypertension therapy. However, the control rate of hypertension hasn't reached the expected requirements currently. ""Three lows"" status quo, just low awareness, low treatment, and low control, are still the major problems confronting modern medicine. Recently, uncontrolled factors of blood pressure are widely concerned, which include insomnia, constipation, mood disorders, exogenous, etc. What's more, the control strategies of hypertension should not only pay close attention to ""patient's high blood pressure"", but also to ""hypertensive patient"". Therefore, the treatment of uncontrolled factors of blood pressure plays an important role in hypertensive therapy, which could be further research priorities."
296,Hypertension in the elderly.,"Several studies have demonstrated an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in relation to high blood pressure in elderly patients aged below 70-75, whereas the risk seemed to decline with age in the older elderly. Early studies on the effect of treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in the elderly indicated (but did not convincingly show) a reduction of CVD. In the 1980s, both the EWPHE trial (European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly) and the HEP study (The Randomised Trial of the Treatment of Hypertension in Elderly Patients in Primary Care) provided evidence of the benefit of treating high blood pressure in the elderly, at least up to the age of 70-74. These results have lately been confirmed by three major trials SHEP (Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program), STOP (Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension) and MRC (Medical Research Council), also including older patients (STOP) and those with isolated systolic hypertension (SHEP). This satisfactory effect was not impaired by a low tolerability of the drugs used (beta-blockers and diuretics). In conclusion, drug treatment with beta-blockers and diuretics in hypertensive men and women aged 70 and above confers highly significant and clinically relevant reductions in cardiovascular (especially stroke) morbidity and mortality. The clinical implication of this is that blood pressure lowering therapy should be considered in elderly hypertensives, at least up until they are 80. It should also be remembered that elderly hypertensives often have other diseases as well and that the drug treatment should be adjusted accordingly."
297,Impaired microvascular dilatation and capillary rarefaction in young adults with a predisposition to high blood pressure.,"Increased vascular resistance in essential hypertension occurs mainly in microvessels with luminal diameters < 100 microm. It is not known whether abnormalities in these vessels are a cause or consequence of high blood pressure (BP). We studied 105 men (aged 23-33 yr) in whom predisposition to high blood pressure has been characterized by both their own BP and those of their parents. Factors that are secondary to high BP correlate with offspring BP irrespective of parental BP, but factors that are components of the familial predisposition to high BP are more closely associated with higher BP in offspring whose parents also have high BP. Offspring with high BP whose parents also have high BP had impaired dermal vasodilatation in the forearm following ischemia and heating (289+/-27 [n = 25] versus 529+/-40 [n = 26], 476+/-38 [n = 30], and 539+/-41 flux units [n = 24] in other groups; P < 0.0001) and fewer capillaries on the dorsum of the finger (23+/-0.8 capillaries/0.25 mm2 versus 26+/-0.8 in all other groups; P < 0.003). Except for BP, other hemodynamic indices (including cardiac output and forearm vascular resistance) were not different. The dermal vessels of men who express a familial predisposition to high BP exhibit increased minimum resistance and capillary rarefaction. Defective angiogenesis may be an etiological component in the inheritance of high BP."
298,The contexts of adherence for African Americans with high blood pressure.,"The contexts of adherence for African Americans with high blood pressure African American men between the ages of 18 and 49 years have the lowest rates of awareness, treatment and control of high blood pressure (HBP) of all age/race/gender groups in the United States. A qualitative study was done to gain an understanding of urban black males' experiences of living with HBP. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 black males. The interviews explored perceptions of health, health problems and priorities, and concerns of daily living that influenced appointment keeping and medication taking. The sample was a subset of 309 men participating in a 3-year clinical trial to improve HBP control in an inner city African-American population. Content analysis of transcribed interviews identified the following themes and related concerns: (a) personal contexts: meaning of health, high blood pressure and treatments; (b) social context: living as a young black male in an urban environment; and (c) cultural context of relating: patient-provider relationship can make a difference. Influencing participants' responses were: interpreting symptoms; adjusting medication taking; protecting personal privacy; allocating limited resources; dealing with addiction; and feeling cared for by a health care provider. Adherence appeared to be multifaceted and changing depending upon: the men's social, economic and personal circumstances; empathetic and non-judgemental assistance from providers; financial concerns and employment; and drug addiction. Findings are useful in refining high blood pressure interventions."
299,The economic impact of hypertension.,"High blood pressure is the most common chronic medical problem prompting visits to primary health care providers, yet it is estimated that only 34% of the 50 million American adults with hypertension have their blood pressure controlled to a level of <140/90 mm Hg. Thus, about two thirds of Americans with hypertension are at increased risk for cardiovascular events. The medical, economic, and human costs of untreated and inadequately controlled high blood pressure are enormous. Adequate management of hypertension can be hampered by inadequacies in the diagnosis, treatment, and/or control of high blood pressure. Health care providers face many obstacles to achieving blood pressure control among their patients, including a limited ability to adequately lower blood pressure with monotherapy and a typical reluctance to increase therapy (either in dose or number of medications) to achieve blood pressure goals. Patients also face important challenges in adhering to multidrug regimens and accepting the need for therapeutic lifestyle changes. Nonetheless, the achievement of blood pressure goals is possible, and, most importantly, lowering blood pressure significantly reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as proved in clinical trials. The medical and human costs of treating preventable conditions such as stroke, heart failure, and end-stage renal disease can be reduced by antihypertensive treatment. The recurrent and chronic morbidities associated with hypertension are costly to treat. Pharmacotherapy for hypertension therefore offers a substantial potential for cost savings. Pharmacoeconomic analyses regarding antihypertensive drug therapies, their costs, and the relevant reductions in health care expenditures are a useful framework for optimizing current strategies for hypertension management."
300,Epidemiology of hypertension.,"Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in virtually all industrialised countries. The limited information available from developing countries suggests that a similar epidemic is inevitable if current trends go unchecked. Treatment of patients with clinical manifestations is an important element in overall management but on its own is an insufficient and incomplete response. Sudden death is often the first manifestation of cardiovascular disease and, even when treatment of disease is applicable and effective, it is usually palliative rather than curative. Thus treatment and prevention directed at the underlying risk factors, including high blood pressure, constitute a complementary and more fundamental approach to reducing the burden of illness. Epidemiological studies provide the scientific foundation for such an approach by identifying the distribution and determinants of high blood pressure in the general population, by establishing the role of high blood pressure as a risk factor for cardiorenal complications, and by quantifying the potential value of treating and preventing high blood pressure in the general population."
301,Prevalence of high blood pressure in children and adolescents. Influence of obesity.,"Obesity is associated with high blood pressure BP, mainly in adults. It has been suggested that body fat patterning plays a role in the etiology of hypertension. This relationship also exists in children, however it is less well known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of high blood pressure (HBP) in children and adolescents, and the influence of obesity on this population, as well as the presence of familial aggregation for these factors. Eight hundred and eighty-nine children (389 boys and 500 girls aged 5-18 years) and their parents, from the North of Portugal were studied. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, weight, height, triceps skinfold, body mass index and sexual maturation were measured. The criterion of high blood pressure was defined as the BP being higher than the 90th percentile. All variables were converted to age and sex in specific ""Z-scores"". A SPSS package was used. We found 47 (5.2%) people of both sexes to have high blood pressure. The children of this group were compared with the normotensive group. These children were heavier (p < 0.005) and more obese (p < 0.0001) than the others. No difference was found for sexual maturation or height. The parents of the group with high blood pressure were heavier (p < 0.001) and more obese (p < 0.01) than the parents of the normotensive group. In conclusion, obesity is an important factor in children with higher values. Children with HBP are more likely to come from families with history of obesity. The identification of these risk factors in children is an important contribution to the prevention of cardiovascular disease in adulthood."
302,What do we (not) know about the management of blood pressure in acute stroke?,"Although it is indisputable that high blood pressure should be treated to prevent a first or a recurrent stroke, the management of high blood pressure in the first hours and days after stroke remains controversial. There is no high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials to guide treatment in the 80% of patients who have elevated blood pressure during the first days after stroke. Theoretically, there are pros and cons for manipulating blood pressure after onset of stroke. Most treatment guidelines suggest leaving blood pressure untouched based on pathophysiologic principles. Post-hoc analyses from randomized trials, however, suggest that elevated blood pressure is associated with recurrent stroke and higher mortality, even after adjustment for potential confounders. On the other hand, preliminary studies have suggested that voluntarily increasing blood pressure might be beneficial in a selected subgroup of patients. In this overview, we present a summary of recent studies on this topic."
303,[Update arterial hypertension 2015].,"Hypertension, defined as office blood pressure of ≥140 mmHg systolic and/or ≥90 mmHg diastolic, is prevalent and one of the most important risk factors for disease and premature death. Diagnostic evaluation includes risk stratification regarding other cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease and asymptomatic organ damage. Currently, treatment is generally recommended with blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg with the goal of reducing values below these limits also in high risk patients. Exceptions concern patients with advanced age or diabetes. Treatment involves lifestyle changes, anthypertensive drugs and in the future probably interventional techniques. This mini-review summarizes selected and practically relevant diagnostic and therapeutic aspects from recent international guidelines."
304,Comparison of agreement between different measures of blood pressure in primary care and daytime ambulatory blood pressure.,"Objective: To assess alternatives to measuring ambulatory pressure, which best predicts response to treatment and adverse outcome. Setting: Three general practices in England. Design: Validation study. Participants: Patients with newly diagnosed high or borderline high blood pressure; patients receiving treatment for hypertension but with poor control. Main outcome measures: Overall agreement with ambulatory pressure; prediction of high ambulatory pressure (>135/85 mm Hg) and treatment thresholds. Results: Readings made by doctors were much higher than ambulatory systolic pressure (difference 18.9 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval 16.1 to 21.7), as were recent readings made in the clinic outside research settings (19.9 mm Hg,17.6 to 22.1). This applied equally to treated patients with poor control (doctor v ambulatory 21.4 mm Hg, 17.3 to 25.4). Doctors' and recent clinic readings ranked systolic pressure poorly compared with ambulatory pressure and other measurements (doctor r=0.46; clinic 0.47; repeated readings by nurse 0.60; repeated self measurement 0.73; home readings 0.75) and were not specific at predicting high blood pressure (doctor 26%; recent clinic 15%; nurse 72%; patient in surgery 81%; home 60%), with poor likelihood ratios for a positive test (doctor 1.2; clinic 1.1; nurse 2.1, patient in surgery 4.7; home 2.2). Nor were doctor or recent clinic measures specific in predicting treatment thresholds. Conclusion: The ""white coat"" effect is important in diagnosing and assessing control of hypertension in primary care and is not a research artefact. If ambulatory or home measurements are not available, repeated measurements by the nurse or patient should result in considerably less unnecessary monitoring, initiation, or changing of treatment. It is time to stop using high blood pressure readings documented by general practitioners to make treatment decisions."
305,Prehypertension and risk of cardiovascular disease.,"Epidemiologic data have established a continuous relationship between vascular risk and blood pressure that extends down to levels as low as 115/75 mmHg, emphasizing the lack of a critical threshold value that defines 'high' blood pressure. Acknowledging the graded and continuous nature of the relations of blood pressure to vascular risk, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VII) introduced the new category 'prehypertension' to describe people with a systolic blood pressure between 120 and 139 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure between 80 and 89 mmHg. It is estimated that 31% of the US population (70 million) has prehypertension. The risk of cardiovascular disease within this large prehypertensive population is not uniform, however, and increases with a rising concomitant burden of other vascular risk factors. Accordingly, a strategy of estimating global cardiovascular risk (by applying standardized risk prediction algorithms) and adjusting the intensity of blood pressure lowering (and reduction of other risk factors) to the absolute risk of cardiovascular disease is desirable in prehypertensive individuals. Adopting a healthier lifestyle, as recommended by JNC VII, is a critical component of the therapeutic approach to prehypertension."
306,"The detection, treatment and control of high blood pressure in older British adults: cross-sectional findings from the British Women's Heart and Health Study and the British Regional Heart Study.","Among older people, the detection and control of hypertension is particularly important to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. This cross-sectional survey aimed to describe the detection, treatment and control of hypertension in older British adults. A total of 3059 women and 3007 men aged 60-79 years were randomly selected from general practice age/sex registers in 24 British towns and examined from 1998 to 2001. Of these, 52.6% women and 47.9% men had at least one indicator of hypertension (high blood pressure on examination, or taking antihypertensive medication or recalled a doctor diagnosis of high blood pressure). Among women, 50% of those with any indication of hypertension were on treatment and 29% were well controlled, and among men 45% were on treatment and 16% were well controlled. With the exception of alcohol use in men (adjusted odds ratio 0.67 (0.46, 0.98)), socioeconomic factors, area of residence and behavioural risk factors were not associated with good control among those with hypertension in either sex. Of those on treatment, 20.7% of women and 28% of men were on two classes of antihypertensive medication and 3.5 and 4.9%, respectively, were on three or more classes of antihypertensive medication. Among those with a doctor diagnosis of hypertension and taking antihypertensive medication, the proportion with well controlled blood pressure did not differ between those on more than one antihypertensive and those on just one in either sex. We conclude that targets of good control are rarely met in older individuals, who would benefit from the associated reduction in cardiovascular disease risk."
307,Cardiovascular and total mortality in men and women with different blood pressure levels--A 26-year follow-up.,"Aim: Our aim was to study different levels of high blood pressure and normal blood pressure (reference) to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular and total mortality in men and women with adjustments for many covariates. Methods: A health-screening program was offered to a population-based sample in Stockholm County to estimate healthcare needs (a proxy for co-morbidity). Blood pressure measurements (mmHg systolic/diastolic) were available for 2280 participants (74%). Mortality was followed up for 26 years. Results: HRs with confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The HR for all-cause mortality in those with very high blood pressure, > or =160 and/or 95, was 1.93 (1.38-2.70) in men and 2.29 (1.42-3.69) in women. High blood pressure (> or = 140 and/or 90 but <160 and 95 cmHg) and prehypertension (> or = 130 and/or 85 but <140 and 90) were significant in women but not in men. Diagnosed hypertension with antihypertensive treatment adjusted for blood pressure level was non-significant in all models. Conclusion: Very high blood pressure was an independent risk factor for both total and cardiovascular mortality in both men and women after adjustments for all covariates including healthcare need. Hypertension seems just as important to treat in individuals with co-morbidities."
308,Pseudohypertension: a diagnostic dilemma.,"Pseudohypertension is a condition in which the indirect measurement of intra-arterial pressure using a sphygmomanometer (cuff pressure) is artifactually high in comparison with directly measured intra-arterial pressure. If unrecognized, pseudohypertension may result in unwarranted and sometimes dangerous treatment. Pseudohypertension results from medial sclerosis and/or calcification of arteries, which markedly decrease their collapsibility. Both the systolic and diastolic pressures are affected. The literature concerning pseudohypertension is quite limited; indeed, the very frequency of the condition is unknown. Very high blood pressure in the absence of significant target organ impairment is an important clue to this subtype of hypertension and should lead to simple diagnostic techniques, such as Osler's maneuver (an attempt to palpate a pulseless radial artery) and radiographs of the soft tissues of the arms. The definitive diagnosis is made by comparing the intra-arterial pressure with the indirectly determined blood pressure."
309,"[Self-care agency ability in people suffering from high blood pressure hospitalised in Bogota, Colombia].","Objective: Describing how hospitalised people who have been diagnosed as having high blood pressure carry out self-care activities. Methodology: A descriptive design, having a quantitative approach, was used for evaluating the self-care agency ability of 90 people who had been hospitalised in Bogotá diagnosed as suffering from high blood pressure. Evers and Isenberg's SAA (self-care agency appreciation) scale was used. Results: The results showed that 53% of people hospitalised suffering from high blood pressure had deficient SAA. Regarding the SAA instrument's items obtaining the highest scores, it was found that the participants were able to maximise attention and vigilance, had motivation or self-care-orientated goals, reasoned within a self-care reference framework, had self-care abilities (cognitive, perception, communication and interpersonal) and integrated self-care operations with other aspects of life. Conclusion: Caring for hypertense people is a challenge for health-care personnel and the whole community. Nursing care should focus on helping individuals to look after themselves, engage in self-care action for conserving their health and lives, recover from illness and confront its consequences."
310,Should family doctors screen asymptomatic children for high blood pressure?,"Whereas the United States Task Forces on Blood Pressure Control in Children have recommended annual blood pressure screening in all children, a working party of the British Hypertension Society has formed the opposite opinion. Relevant literature is reviewed here, and the conclusion reached that on epidemiological and ethical grounds, screening children for hypertension cannot at present be justified."
311,Hypertension control: multifactorial contributions.,"Treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of several associated deleterious conditions, although it does not lower risk for all cardiovascular diseases. A new theory suggests that high blood pressure is but one piece in the puzzle of a complex syndrome of inherited risk factors called the hypertension syndrome. Several new findings have emerged theorizing that patients may have coronary artery disease before the actual onset of elevated blood pressure. Epidemiologic studies have found that normotensive patients with a family history of hypertension often have a disease process and prognosis similar to that of hypertensives. It seems that some patients may ""inherit"" abnormalities that make them prone to the development of hypertension, as well as a complex series of cardiovascular disease risk factors. These include elevated lipids, increased left ventricular hypertrophy, arterial stiffening, insulin resistance, renal function abnormalities, and neuroendocrine changes. It is conceivable that the hypertension syndrome may be reversible if the disease process is diagnosed early, which appears to be well before the actual onset of high blood pressure. High blood pressure may be a risk marker for irreversible vascular disease and early detection of the many components of hypertension syndrome may delay or prevent cardiovascular disease from developing in high-risk patients."
312,"Prevalence of hypertension and prehypertension in adolescence in Ahvaz, Iran.","Background: High blood pressure is a risk factor for some disease like stroke, coronary heart disease, and renal failure. High blood pressure in children is an increasing health problem. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of hypertension and pre-hypertension age between 10 to 17 years old. Patients and methods: This descriptive analytic study was conducted using multiphase sampling method in Ahvaz (Southwest of Iran). A questionnaire include: height, weight, and body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures filled for each participant. Blood pressure was measured twice for each person. For the diagnosis of hypertension, the fourth report of the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents of the National Health Institute of United States was used. Results: Total participants of the study were 1707children and adolescents including 922 boys (54%) and 785 girls (46%). The prevalence of high blood pressure was 1.7% (2.5% in boys and 0.8%). The prevalence of pre-hypertension was 9%(7.6% in boys, 10.6% in girls). The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased with increasing body mass index. Conclusions: The prevalence of high blood pressure was found to be lower than other studies in our country. The prevalence of the high blood pressure in boys was significantly higher than girls. This study, like other studies showed high correlation between being overweight and an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure."
313,"The 1988 report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.","The National High Blood Pressure Education Program has released three Joint National Committee reports and a task force report on the detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure. Like its predecessors, the 1988 Joint National Committee report was developed using the consensus process; it is based on the latest scientific research and reflects the state of the art regarding hypertension management. This report updates findings of previous reports in several respects: it broadens the step-care approach to provide more flexibility for clinicians; encourages greater patient involvement in the treatment program; emphasizes a consideration of the quality of life in the management of patients; and addresses the cost of care. It also provides more emphasis on control of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease; includes a discussion of the new cholesterol guidelines; recommends a reduction in alcohol consumption; and discusses the use of calcium and fish oil supplementation. This document expands earlier reports on special populations, including blacks and other racial and ethnic minority groups, young and elderly patients, pregnant patients, surgical candidates, and hypertensive patients with cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchial asthma, gout, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The report also updates previous drug tables to include new drugs, revised recommended doses of some drugs, and drug interactions. Consideration of step-down therapy after blood pressure has been controlled is suggested. This report is intended as a guide for practicing physicians and other health professionals in their care of hypertensive patients and as a reference for those participating in the many community high blood pressure control programs throughout the country."
314,[Cardiovascular hyperactivity in patients with family history of high blood pressure].,"Background and objective: The association between family history of essential high blood pressure (FH of HBP) and the cardiovascular hyperactivity to the isometric exercise is not well known; that is why the aim of this study was to describe this relation and to determine whether it is independent of the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. Patients and method: We carried out a correlational descriptive study with a sample of 1855 people of both sexes between 18 and 70 years of age. The cardiovascular hyperactivity, expression of the cardiovascular response to the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), was determined by means of the test of the sustained weight (TSW). Comparisons of the values of cardiovascular reactivity were developed between individuals with and without FH of HBP and a model of logistical regression. The level of statistical significance was 95%. Results: The arterial blood pressure at the end of the TSW was higher in individuals with FH of HBP independently of the age group. The cardiovascular hyperactivity, measured by means of they systolic index of cardiovascular reactivity, was also significantly higher in subjects with FH of HBP. Finally, individuals with FH of HBP showed a higher risk (more than 5 times) of having cardiovascular hyperactivity (OR = 5.16; CI 95%, 3.51-7.59), this association being independent of other cardiovascular factors of risk. Conclusions: The FH of HBP is independently related to the cardiovascular hyperactivity, to the isometric exercise, of other cardiovascular risks factors. These elements help explain the relationship between cardiovascular hyperactivity, the activity of SNS and essential high blood pressure, at least in an important group of people."
315,Hypertension Management at Older Age: An Update.,"Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with increasing prevalence with age, whose treatment is associated with benefits over fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events even later in life. However, there are persistent concerns on the short- and long-term weighted benefits of treating hypertension in the very old, particularly in those with specific clinical features. In fact, a broad range of clinical scenarios can be observed at older ages, spanning from the healthy to the frailest patient, and hypertension clinical trials have traditionally excluded the latter, thus preventing the unconditioned application to these patients of the same recommendations as in younger ages. Persistent issues regarding high blood pressure management in the very old adult are mainly related to treatment threshold and targets, which have been differently addressed by American and European guidelines. Herein, we will examine the challenges related to high blood pressure treatment in healthy and frail older and very old adults. We will discuss the evidence behind current recommendations. Finally, we will recapitulate the recommended treatment options for high blood pressure in these patients in the light of the most recent guidelines."
316,Etiology of essential hypertension.,"It is not possible to understand the etiology of hypertension without considering the role of inheritance. Epidemiological evidence indicates that the development of high blood pressure in the population at large depends on the interaction of different types of genes and several environmental influences. The sources of genetic variation in blood pressure distribution are polygenes, polymorphic genes, and dominant idiomorphic genes. The main environmental sources are weight gain, excess salt (Na) intake, and psychosocial stress. Only those individuals with a specific genetic predisposition may develop high blood pressure when exposed to excessive environmental influences."
317,Hypertension in children and adolescents.,"Background: Children have lower blood pressure than adults do, and normal values for children have been established based on age and also on height and weight. Blood pressures in childhood correlate with blood pressures in adulthood, although weakly; a stronger correlation has been established between obesity in childhood and adulthood. Further, obese people are more likely to have high blood pressure than are slender people, both as children and adults. In hypertensive children, the higher the blood pressure and the earlier hypertension appears, the more likely is a secondary cause. Key points: Physicians should measure and record children's blood pressure, just as they do their height and weight. An algorithm can help physicians decide whether a child with high blood pressure needs further workup and treatment. Nonpharmacologic therapy includes dietary sodium restriction, weight reduction (if the child is overweight), aerobic exercise, and relaxation. In some cases pharmacologic therapy may be necessary. In general, all children should be encouraged to be physically active and to eat healthy foods."
318,Non-pharmacological intervention in primary hypertension in childhood.,"In children with blood pressure levels persistently in the upper part of the distribution and without evidence for known causes of hypertension, one may ask which approach should be used to lower blood pressure. In general, non-pharmacological intervention will be preferred over drug treatment as a first choice in children with primary hypertension. No specific non-pharmacological treatment is available for children with high blood pressure. The main objective of this review is to underscore the need for further intervention studies in hypertensive children. Although the scientific evidence is rather scanty, some general recommendations concerning body weight, physical activity and fitness, dietary intake of electrolytes and relaxation procedures can be made. In obese children, weight reduction, combined with increase of physical activity, is the measure of first choice to lower blood pressure. In children with a high sympathetic outflow, as evidenced by high levels of circulating catecholamines, increase of physical activity and use of relaxation procedures may be the first approach to lower blood pressure. In children with evidence for disturbances in electrolyte metabolism, as evidenced by high intralymphocytic sodium, low serum calcium, or high PTH, a dietary approach to high blood pressure may be used. In these children, an increase of potassium intake or calcium intake seems a promising way to lower blood pressure."
319,"New staging system of the fifth Joint National Committee report on the detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (JNC-V) alters assessment of the severity and treatment of hypertension.","The fifth Joint National Committee report on the detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (JNC-V) introduced a new system of blood pressure classification that incorporated systolic blood pressure (SBP) and established new diastolic blood pressure (DBP) cut points. With the previous JNC classification, subjects were classified according to DBP alone. In this study, our purpose was to assess the effect of the new staging system on the assessment of hypertension severity and to determine whether' the new JNC-V staging system better identifies individuals at risk for hypertensive target-organ damage. We compared the assessment of hypertension severity using JNC-IV with that using JNC-V in 1158 subjects enrolled in the Harlem Hospital Hypertension Clinic database from 1975 to 1992. We used pretreatment DBP to classify subjects according to JNC-IV criteria. These subjects were reclassified into one of the four stages of JNC-V. The assessment of hypertension severity and prevalence of organ damage in subjects who remained in the same category of severity in both systems was compared with damage in subjects who were upstaged. With the JNC-V classification, 321 subjects remained in the same category, and 837 were upstaged. Six hundred and four subjects moved up because of the new cut points of DBP, and 275 were upstaged because of higher SBP. Upstaged subjects had more manifestations of hypertensive target-organ damage. With the new JNC-V classification system, hypertension is assessed as severe or very severe in more individuals than with JNC-IV. Subjects who are upstaged in JNC-V are more likely to have evidence of renal disease and other target-organ damage."
320,Electrolyte and Acid-Base Disorders in Chronic Kidney Disease and End-Stage Kidney Failure.,"The kidneys play a pivotal role in the regulation of electrolyte and acid-base balance. With progressive loss of kidney function, derangements in electrolytes and acid-base inevitably occur and contribute to poor patient outcomes. As chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a worldwide epidemic, medical providers are increasingly confronted with such problems. Adequate diagnosis and treatment will minimize complications and can potentially be lifesaving. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the disease process, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment strategies, integrating up-to-date knowledge in the field. Although electrolyte and acid-base derangements are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in CKD and end-stage renal disease patients, they can be effectively managed through a timely institution of combined preventive measures and pharmacological therapy. Exciting advances and several upcoming outcome trials will provide further information to guide treatment and improve patient outcomes."
321,Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Chronic kidney disease is highly prevalent (10-13% of the population), irreversible, progressive, and associated with higher cardiovascular risk. Patients with this pathology remain asymptomatic most of the time, presenting the complications typical of renal dysfunction only in more advanced stages. Its treatment can be conservative (patients without indication for dialysis, usually those with glomerular filtration rate above 15 ml/minute) or replacement therapy (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation). The objectives of the conservative treatment for chronic kidney disease are to slow down the progression of kidney dysfunction, treat complications (anemia, bone diseases, cardiovascular diseases), vaccination for hepatitis B, and preparation for kidney replacement therapy."
322,[Diagnosis and treatment of chronic kidney disease].,"Chronic kidney disease is defined by decreased glomerular filtration rate or proteinuria. Diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive renal damage are responsible for the majority of cases. The initiation of therapy has to consider if causal treatment of the underlying disease is possible and indicated. In all patients, even if specific treatment is not possible, therapy should aim at reducing progression of kidney failure. Chronic kidney diseases tend to intrinsic deterioration that persists after cessation of the causative damaging pathomechanism. Progression of disease can be delayed; the most important measures include strict blood pressure control, reduction of proteinuria, and avoidance of further renal harm. Kidney disease induces typical sequelae such as left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular calcification, anemia, and renal osteodystrophy. While these are well understood nowadays therapeutic options are limited. The uremic syndrome is to be avoided by renal replacement therapy."
323,A perspective on chronic kidney disease progression.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) will progress to end stage without treatment, but the decline of renal function may not be linear. Compared with glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria, new surrogate markers, such as kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated protein, apolipoprotein A-IV, and soluble urokinase receptor, may allow potential intervention and treatment in the earlier stages of CKD, which could be useful for clinical trials. New omic-based technologies reveal potential new genomic and epigenomic mechanisms that appear different from those causing the initial disease. Various clinical studies also suggest that acute kidney injury is a major risk for progressive CKD. To ameliorate the progression of CKD, the first step is optimizing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade. New drugs targeting endothelin, transforming growth factor-β, oxidative stress, and inflammatory- and cell-based regenerative therapy may have add-on benefit."
324,Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease: From the laboratory to the clinic.,"Chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury have traditionally been considered as separate entities with different etiologies. This view has changed in recent years, with chronic kidney disease recognized as a major risk factor for the development of new acute kidney injury, and acute kidney injury now accepted to lead to de novo or accelerated chronic and end stage kidney diseases. Patients with existing chronic kidney disease appear to be less able to mount a complete 'adaptive' repair after acute insults, and instead repair maladaptively, with accelerated fibrosis and rates of renal functional decline. This article reviews the epidemiological studies in man that have demonstrated the links between these two processes. We also examine clinical and experimental research in areas of importance to both acute and chronic disease: acute and chronic renal injury to the vasculature, the pericyte and leukocyte populations, the signaling pathways implicated in injury and repair, and the impact of cellular stress and increased levels of growth arrested and senescent cells. The importance and therapeutic potential raised by these processes for acute and chronic injury are discussed."
325,A Review of Pediatric Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Chronic kidney disease is complex in both adults and children, but the disease is far from the same between these populations. Here we review the marked differences in etiology, comorbidities, impact of disease on growth and quality of life, issues unique to adolescents and transitions to adult care, and special considerations of congenital kidney and urinary tract anomalies for transplantation."
326,Chronic Kidney Disease and Pregnancy.,"Women with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at risk for adverse pregnancy-associated outcomes, including progression of their underlying renal dysfunction, a flare of their kidney disease, and adverse pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and preterm delivery. Earlier-stage CKD, as a rule, is a safer time to have a pregnancy, but even women with end-stage kidney disease have attempted pregnancy in recent years. As such, nephrologists need to be comfortable with pregnancy preparation and management at all stages of CKD. In this article, we review the renal physiologic response to pregnancy and the literature with respect to both expected maternal and fetal outcomes among young women at various stages of CKD, including those who attempt to conceive while on dialysis. The general management of young women with CKD and associated complications, including hypertension and proteinuria are discussed. Finally, the emotional impact these pregnancies may have on young women with a chronic disease and the potential benefits of care in a multidisciplinary environment are highlighted."
327,"The definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease: a KDIGO Controversies Conference report.","The definition and classification for chronic kidney disease was proposed by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) in 2002 and endorsed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) in 2004. This framework promoted increased attention to chronic kidney disease in clinical practice, research and public health, but has also generated debate. It was the position of KDIGO and KDOQI that the definition and classification should reflect patient prognosis and that an analysis of outcomes would answer key questions underlying the debate. KDIGO initiated a collaborative meta-analysis and sponsored a Controversies Conference in October 2009 to examine the relationship of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria to mortality and kidney outcomes. On the basis of analyses in 45 cohorts that included 1,555,332 participants from general, high-risk, and kidney disease populations, conference attendees agreed to retain the current definition for chronic kidney disease of a GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio >30 mg/g, and to modify the classification by adding albuminuria stage, subdivision of stage 3, and emphasizing clinical diagnosis. Prognosis could then be assigned based on the clinical diagnosis, stage, and other key factors relevant to specific outcomes. KDIGO has now convened a workgroup to develop a global clinical practice guideline for the definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease."
328,Nutrition education in the care of patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.,"Diet counseling and nutrition education are recommended in the prevention and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The importance of effectively addressing nutrition with patients has grown given the increasing prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes; conditions which influence CKD/ESRD. Dietary advice for individuals with CKD/ESRD can be seen as complex; and successful dietary management requires careful planning, periodic assessment of nutritional status, as well as monitoring of dietary compliance. In spite of recommendations and pressing need, formal training in nutrition and adequate preparation for providers is limited; and for physicians the lack of nutrition education has been acknowledged, repeatedly, as an area for improvement in medical training curricula. It has also been suggested that dietitians have an essential role in management of CKD in the primary care setting; however, dietitians who do not practice renal education daily may need training on the specific challenges in CKD/ESRD. The objectives of this chapter were to: characterize select nutrition education resources for providers who care for patients with CKD/ESRD; summarize key dietary components emphasized in the care of patients with CKD/ESRD; and address practical considerations in educational efforts focused on nutrition and CKD/ESRD."
329,Management of Heart Failure in Advancing CKD: Core Curriculum 2018.,"Heart failure and chronic kidney disease have increasing incidence and prevalence owing in part to the aging population and increasing rates of hypertension, diabetes, and other cardiovascular and kidney disease risk factors. The presence of one condition also has a strong influence on the other, leading to greater risks for hospitalization, morbidity, and death, as well as very high health care costs. Despite the frequent coexistence of heart failure and chronic kidney disease, many of the pivotal randomized trials that guide the management of heart failure have excluded patients with more advanced stages of chronic kidney disease. In this Core Curriculum article, management of a challenging, yet not unusual, case of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in a patient with stage 4 chronic kidney disease provides an opportunity to review the relevant literature and highlight gaps in our knowledge."
330,[Characteristics and epidemiology of chronic kidney disease].,"Today in France, more than 5% of the population suffers from chronic kidney disease and its prevalence is increasing. It is important to detect these pathologies early and to provide patients with a multidisciplinary care programme in which nephrologists, endocrinologists and cardiologists coordinate their approach."
331,Approaches to Medication Management in Patients with Kidney Failure Opting for Conservative Management.,"After consideration of risks and benefits, some patients with kidney failure choose conservative management. Conservative management of kidney failure (CM-KF) does not include dialysis or transplant and utilizes primarily pharmacologic strategies for symptom management, which can be challenging due to the number and complexity of symptoms. Additionally, there are safety concerns regarding altered pharmacokinetics and the adverse effects induced by some of the therapies that may be selected to treat symptoms. This review describes common kidney failure symptoms and provides recommendations for pharmacologic management in CM-KF. Selection of medication should be individualized to the patient and comorbidities, drug interactions, cost, and adverse effects should be carefully considered. Additional studies specifically focused on CM-KF are needed."
332,Age and treatment of kidney failure.,"Purpose of review: This review discusses issues related to treatment of chronic kidney disease, and kidney failure in particular, among older adults. Recent findings: A substantial proportion of older adults have chronic kidney disease and progress to kidney failure. There is considerable variability in treatment practices for advanced kidney disease among older adults, and evidence that treatment decisions such as dialysis initiation may be made without adequate preparation. When initiated, survival among older adults on chronic dialysis remains poor, and is associated with a significant decline in functional status. There is also evidence to suggest that dialysis initiation may not reflect overall treatment goals of elderly patients, but rather a lack of clear communication between patients and health practitioners, and underdeveloped conservative care programs in many centers. Summary: Kidney failure is common among older adults. When considering treatment options for kidney failure, patient priorities, preferences, and symptoms should be taken into account, using a shared decision-making approach."
333,[Chronic kidney disease and renal failure due to lithium treatment].,"Lithium has been approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder since the 1970s and even today it is considered a first-line drug for the treatment of this disease. As bipolar disorder often begins between 15-35 years of age and requires long-term treatment, the assessment of the adverse effects of the drugs used is critical. Recently, there has been renewed interest on the risk of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure induced by lithium, with findings suggesting that both complications could be more frequent than previously considered. These data have led to question traditional measures of monitoring renal function such as levels of urea and creatinine, which show signifcant increases only after an important reduction of the glomerular filtration rate. Preliminary data have suggested that certain biomarkers of kidney injury, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, may be more sensitive indicators of renal damage. The use of new biomarkers that allow early detection of kidney damage could be useful for the monitoring of patients treated with lithium."
334,Palliative and end-of-life care issues in chronic kidney disease.,"Purpose of review: Patients with progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high morbidity, mortality, and symptom burden. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) often contribute to these burdens and should be considered when providing recommendations for care. This review aims to summarize recent literature relevant to the provision of palliative and end-of-life care for patients with progressive CKD and specifically highlights issues relevant to those with CVD and CHF. Recent findings: Dialysis may not benefit older, frail patients with progressive CKD, especially those with other comorbidities. Patients managed conservatively (i.e., without dialysis) may live as long as patients who elect to start dialysis, with better preservation of function and quality of life and with fewer acute care admissions. Decisions regarding dialysis initiation should be made on an individual basis, keeping in mind each patient's goals, comorbidities, and underlying functional status. Conservative management of progressive kidney disease is frequently not offered but is likely to benefit many older, frail patients with comorbidities such as CHF and CVD. Summary: A palliative approach to the care of many patients with progressive CKD is essential to ensuring they receive appropriate quality care."
335,Antibiotic Dosing in Chronic Kidney Disease and End-Stage Renal Disease: A Focus on Contemporary Challenges.,"Infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with chronic kidney disease. Therefore, appropriate antibiotic dosing is imperative to achieve positive patient outcomes while minimizing antibiotic dose-related toxicity. Accurately assessing renal function and determining the influence of renal replacement therapy on antibiotic clearance makes drug dosing in this patient population challenging. Furthermore, as technological advances in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis occur, research incorporating newer dialysis parameters to guide drug dosing may not be readily available. Currently, there are limited data to guide drug dosing in the setting of automated peritoneal dialysis, short daily hemodialysis, and nocturnal hemodialysis. Antibiotic-dosing recommendations should be carefully evaluated considering the accuracy of the renal function assessment, the similarity of the operating characteristics of the renal replacement therapy studied compared with those being used, and whether the dosing strategy takes advantage of the pharmacodynamic profile of the antibiotic under consideration. After implementing the antibiotic-dosing regimen, therapeutic drug monitoring should occur when possible along with careful monitoring for antibiotic efficacy and safety."
336,Diabetes mellitus as a risk factor for incident chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in women compared with men: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Whether sex differences in chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease incidence exist among diabetic patients remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the relative effect of diabetes on chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease risk in women compared with men. We systematically searched Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library for both cohort and case-control studies until October 2015. Studies were selected if they reported a sex-specific relationship between diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. We generated pooled estimates across studies using random-effects meta-analysis after log transformation with inverse variance weighting. Ten studies with data from more than 5 million participants were included. The pooled adjusted risk ratio of chronic kidney disease associated with diabetes mellitus was 3.34 (95 % CI 2.27, 4.93) in women and 2.84 (95 % CI 1.73, 4.68) in men. The data showed no difference in diabetes-related chronic kidney disease risk between the sexes (pooled adjusted women-to-men relative risk ratio was 1.14 [95 % CI 0.97, 1.34]) except for end-stage renal disease-the pooled adjusted women-to men relative risk ratio was 1.38 (95 % CI 1.22, 1.55; p = 0.114, I² = 38.1 %). The study found no evidence of a sex difference in the association between diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. However, the excess risk for end-stage renal disease was higher in women with diabetes than in men with the same condition, from which we assume that the female gender could accelerate the disease progression. Further studies are needed to support this notion and elucidate the underlying mechanisms."
337,Acute Kidney Injury: Tubular Markers and Risk for Chronic Kidney Disease and End-Stage Kidney Failure.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical syndrome directly related to patient short-term and long-term morbidity and mortality. Over the last decade, the occurrence rate of AKI has been increasing, and there has also been a growing epidemic of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESRD) linked to severe and repeated episodes of AKIs. The detection and management of AKI are currently far from satisfactory. A large proportion of AKI patients, especially those with preexisting CKD, are at an increased risk of non-resolving AKI and progressing to CKD and ESRD. Proposed pathological processes that contribute to the transition of AKI to CKD and ESRD include severity and frequency of kidney injury, alterations of tubular cell phenotype with cells predominantly in the G2/M phase, interstitial fibrosis and microvascular rarification related to loss of endothelial-pericyte interactions and pericyte dedifferentiation. Innate immune responses, especially dendritic cell responses related to inadequate adenosine receptor (2a)-mediated signals, autophagic insufficiency and renin-angiotensin system activation have also been implicated in the progression of AKI and transitions from AKI to CKD and ESRD. Although promising advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of AKI and AKI consequences, much more work needs to be done in developing biomarkers for detecting early kidney injury, prognosticating kidney disease progression and developing strategies to effectively treat AKI and to minimize AKI progression to CKD and ESRD."
338,Nephrology consultation and kidney failure in people with stage 4 chronic kidney disease: a population-based cohort study.,"Background: Guidelines recommend referral for nephrology consultation for people with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) to improve care and renal outcomes, yet the advocated benefits of nephrology referral on CKD progression in this patient population are unclear. Methods: We linked laboratory and administrative data in Alberta, Canada to identify adults with stage 4 CKD between 2002 and 2014 (follow-up end on March 31, 2017). We studied the association between time-varying receipt of outpatient nephrology consultation and kidney failure (the earlier of renal replacement initiation or eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 for more than 3 months), accounting for the competing risk of death. Results: Of the 14,382 participants, 41% were ≥ 85 years old, 33% saw a nephrologist as an outpatient, 9% developed kidney failure, and 53% died over a median of 2.6 years. Compared with people who did not see a nephrologist before or at 7 months (median time to consultation), those who did were more likely to develop kidney failure [5-year risk (95% CI) 0.23 (0.21-0.24) vs 0.07 (0.065-0.075)]. With increasing age or higher eGFR, the 5-year risk of kidney failure became progressively smaller, from 0.24 (0.18-0.29) at age < 65 to 0.01 (0.006-0.015) at age ≥ 85 years and from 0.21 (0.18-0.23) at eGFR 15-19 to 0.066 (0.060-0.072) at eGFR 25-29 mL/min/1.73 m2; yet, the hazard ratio of kidney failure (1.6-4.3) increased following nephrology consultation in people who were older or had higher eGFR. Conclusions: Adults with stage 4 CKD who see a nephrologist are more likely to develop kidney failure than those who don't, especially within lower absolute risk categories. Although selective referral may explain these findings, there is no evidence of an association between nephrology care and reduced risk of kidney failure in people with severe CKD. Studies are needed to assess the benefits of nephrology consultation in people with moderate CKD."
339,[Overview of peritoneal dialysis].,"Peritoneal dialysis is a dialysis modality used worldwide. Despite offering several advantages, its prevalence in Switzerland in end stage renal disease population is dramatically lower than hemodialysis (7.3% vs 92.7% in 2014) although its incidence has recently progressed. Technically, a catheter is inserted into the Douglas' pouch, enabling dialysate to be infused into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneum acts as a semi-permeable membrane allowing for the removal of toxic substances and excess water. In the following article we will give an overview of peritoneal dialysis including its technical modalities, indications and main advantages as well as its contraindications and complications."
340,Update on Anemia in ESRD and Earlier Stages of CKD: Core Curriculum 2018.,"Anemia is a frequent complication during the later stages of chronic kidney disease. When present, it may cause symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath. The pathogenesis of anemia in chronic kidney disease is complex, but a central feature is a relative deficit of erythropoietin. New information has elucidated the critical role of the hypoxia-sensing system in mediating erythropoietin synthesis and release. Iron deficiency is a second important factor in the anemia of chronic kidney disease. New insights into the dynamics of iron metabolism have clarified the role of chronic inflammation and hepcidin as key mediators of impaired iron utilization. In this article, we review the epidemiology, pathobiology, clinical evaluation, and treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease."
341,Targeting the transcription factor Nrf2 to ameliorate oxidative stress and inflammation in chronic kidney disease.,"Oxidative stress and inflammation are mediators in the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its complications, and they are inseparably linked as each begets and amplifies the other. CKD-associated oxidative stress is due to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and diminished antioxidant capacity. The latter is largely caused by impaired activation of Nrf2, the transcription factor that regulates genes encoding antioxidant and detoxifying molecules. Protective effects of Nrf2 are evidenced by amelioration of oxidative stress, inflammation, and kidney disease in response to natural Nrf2 activators in animal models, while Nrf2 deletion amplifies these pathogenic pathways and leads to autoimmune nephritis. Given the role of impaired Nrf2 activity in CKD-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, interventions aimed at restoring Nrf2 may be effective in retarding CKD progression. Clinical trials of the potent Nrf2 activator bardoxolone methyl showed significant improvement in renal function in CKD patients with type 2 diabetes. However, due to unforeseen complications the BEACON trial, which was designed to investigate the effect of this drug on time to end-stage renal disease or cardiovascular death in patients with advanced CKD, was prematurely terminated. This article provides an overview of the role of impaired Nrf2 activity in the pathogenesis of CKD-associated oxidative stress and inflammation and the potential utility of targeting Nrf2 in the treatment of CKD."
342,The role of melatonin treatment in chronic kidney disease.,"The pineal hormone melatonin plays a major role in circadian sleep-wake rhythm. Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), especially those who are on hemodialysis, frequently suffer from sleep disturbances. In this review an overview is given of the classification of stages of chronic kidney disease, followed by a presentation of the circadian rhythm disorders in renal disease involving sleep disturbances in relation to melatonin deficiency. The therapeutic benefit of melatonin treatment in sleep disorders related to chronic kidney disease including the controlled trials solving this topic, is described. Furthermore, the beneficial effect of melatonin on blood pressure alterations in CKD states and the protection of melatonin in oxidative stress and inflammation in renal disorders are explored. Finally a hypothetic model is described for the relation between circadian rhythm disorders and CKD."
343,Influence of Mortality on Estimating the Risk of Kidney Failure in People with Stage 4 CKD.,"Background: Most kidney failure risk calculators are based on methods that censor for death. Because mortality is high in people with severe, nondialysis-dependent CKD, censoring for death may overestimate their risk of kidney failure. Methods: Using 2002-2014 population-based laboratory and administrative data for adults with stage 4 CKD in Alberta, Canada, we analyzed the time to the earliest of kidney failure, death, or censoring, using methods that censor for death and methods that treat death as a competing event factoring in age, sex, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, eGFR, and albuminuria. Stage 4 CKD was defined as a sustained eGFR of 15-30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Results: Of the 30,801 participants (106,447 patient-years at risk; mean age 77 years), 18% developed kidney failure and 53% died. The observed risk of the combined end point of death or kidney failure was 64% at 5 years and 87% at 10 years. By comparison, standard risk calculators that censored for death estimated these risks to be 76% at 5 years and >100% at 7.5 years. Censoring for death increasingly overestimated the risk of kidney failure over time from 7% at 5 years to 19% at 10 years, especially in people at higher risk of death. For example, the overestimation of 5-year absolute risk ranged from 1% in a woman without diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or albuminuria and with an eGFR of 25 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (9% versus 8%), to 27% in a man with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, albuminuria >300 mg/d, and an eGFR of 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (78% versus 51%). Conclusions: Kidney failure risk calculators should account for death as a competing risk to increase their accuracy and utility for patients and providers."
344,"Urine Potassium Excretion, Kidney Failure, and Mortality in CKD.","Background: Low urine potassium excretion, as a surrogate for dietary potassium intake, is associated with higher risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease in a general population. Few studies have investigated the relationship of urine potassium with clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Study design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting & participants: The MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) Study was a randomized controlled trial (N = 840) conducted in 1989 to 1993 to examine the effects of blood pressure control and dietary protein restriction on kidney disease progression in adults aged 18 to 70 years with CKD stages 2 to 4. This post hoc analysis included 812 participants. Predictor: The primary predictor variable was 24-hour urine potassium excretion, measured at baseline and at multiple time points (presented as time-updated average urine potassium excretion). Outcomes: Kidney failure, defined as initiation of dialysis therapy or transplantation, was determined from US Renal Data System data. All-cause mortality was assessed using the National Death Index. Results: Median follow-up for kidney failure was 6.1 (IQR, 3.5-11.7) years, with 9 events/100 patient-years. Median all-cause mortality follow-up was 19.2 (IQR, 10.8-20.6) years, with 3 deaths/100 patient-years. Baseline mean urine potassium excretion was 2.39±0.89 (SD) g/d. Each 1-SD higher baseline urine potassium level was associated with an adjusted HR of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.87-1.04) for kidney failure and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.94) for all-cause mortality. Results were consistent using time-updated average urine potassium measurements. Limitations: Analyses were performed using urine potassium excretion as a surrogate for dietary potassium intake. Results are obtained from a primarily young, nondiabetic, and advanced CKD population and may not be generalizable to the general CKD population. Conclusions: Higher urine potassium excretion was associated with lower risk for all-cause mortality, but not kidney failure."
345,Heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic integrative review.,"Introduction: Heart failure (HF) is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is strongly associated with mortality in these patients. However, the treatment of HF in this population is largely unclear. Study design: We conducted a systematic integrative review of the literature to assess the current evidence of HF treatment in CKD patients, searching electronic databases in April 2014. Synthesis used narrative methods. Setting and population: We focused on adults with a primary diagnosis of CKD and HF. Selection criteria for studies: We included studies of any design, quantitative or qualitative. Interventions: HF treatment was defined as any formal means taken to improve the symptoms of HF and/or the heart structure and function abnormalities. Outcomes: Measures of all kinds were considered of interest. Results: Of 1,439 results returned by database searches, 79 articles met inclusion criteria. A further 23 relevant articles were identified by hand searching. Conclusions: Control of fluid overload, the use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and optimization of dialysis appear to be the most important methods to treat HF in CKD and ESRD patients. Aldosterone antagonists and digitalis glycosides may additionally be considered; however, their use is associated with significant risks. The role of anemia correction, control of CKD-mineral and bone disorder, and cardiac resynchronization therapy are also discussed."
346,How Do I Manage Hypertension in Patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease Not on Dialysis? Perspectives from Clinical Practice.,"In the general population, the prevalence of moderate and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is usually below 5% but this figure is often higher in specific groups of patients such as those with type 2 diabetes. Patients with advanced CKD (CKD stage 3b and 4) are at high or very high cardiovascular risk, and their risk of progressing towards end-stage kidney disease (CKD stage 5) and the need of renal replacement therapy are elevated. Hypertension is a major cause of poor cardiovascular and renal outcomes in severe CKD. Therefore, an adequate control of blood pressure (BP) is mandatory. However, normalizing BP is often challenging in these patients because the clinical management of hypertension in advanced CKD is not well defined and rarely supported by large randomized controlled trials. In the present review, we discuss the characteristics of hypertension in advanced CKD, excluding dialysis, and its management integrating data from recent clinical studies and a pragmatic approach enriched by a long-standing clinical experience."
347,[Frequency of kidney failure in cardiologic patients: the need to search].,"Background: Chronic kidney disease is a major health problem since it is associated with a high cardiovascular risk, total morbidity and mortality, increasing prevalence and high cost treatment. Aim: To assess the frequency of chronic kidney disease among patients consulting in a cardiology clinic. Material and methods: Cross-sectional assessment of 649 patients attended at a cardiology clinic. Demographic, clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and laboratory variables were registered. Patients were considered to have a kidney failure when their estimated glomerular filtration rate was < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. Kidney failure was considered chronic if this alteration lasted ≥ 3 months and hidden when serum creatinine levels were normal. Results: The frequency of kidney failure was 20.8% (28.4% in patients ≥ 65 years old). The mean age of patients with the disease was 71.5 ± 9.1 years and 52% were women. Eighty seven percent were in stage 3, 10% in stage 4 and 3% in stage 5. Among patients with kidney failure, in 114 (84%) it was chronic and in 28%, hidden. The latter was observed almost exclusively in women with creatinine levels of approximately 1 mg/dl. Hypertension (Odds ratio (OR) 4.2), age (OR 1.1), ventricular ejection fraction (OR 0.97) and low hemoglobin (OR 0.735) were the risk factors for kidney failure detected in the multivariate analysis. Conclusions: The frequency of kidney failure (chronic or hidden) was high in this group of cardiologic patients. Most patients had a mild to moderate failure and the risk factors were hypertension, age, low ventricular ejection fraction and low hemoglobin levels."
348,Epigenetics of kidney disease.,"DNA methylation and histone modifications determine renal programming and the development and progression of renal disease. The identification of the way in which the renal cell epigenome is altered by environmental modifiers driving the onset and progression of renal diseases has extended our understanding of the pathophysiology of kidney disease progression. In this review, we focus on current knowledge concerning the implications of epigenetic modifications during renal disease from early development to chronic kidney disease progression including renal fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy and the translational potential of identifying new biomarkers and treatments for the prevention and therapy of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease."
349,Kidney-brain crosstalk in the acute and chronic setting.,"Patients with kidney disease often exhibit multiple organ dysfunction that is caused, in part, by marked connectivity between the kidney and other organs and tissues. Substantial crosstalk occurs between the kidney and the brain, as indicated by the frequent presentation of neurological disorders, such as cerebrovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and neuropathy during the natural history of chronic kidney disease. The underlying pathophysiology of such comorbid neurological disorders in kidney disease is governed by shared anatomic and vasoregulatory systems and humoral and non-humoral bidirectional pathways that affect both the kidney and the brain. During acute kidney injury, the brain and kidney might interact through the amplification of cytokine-induced damage, extravasation of leukocytes, oxidative stress, and dysregulation of sodium, potassium, and water channels. The advent of dialysis and renal transplantation programmes has led to a reduction in the rate of neurological complications associated with uraemia, but a new set of complications have arisen as a consequence of the effects of dialysis on the central nervous system over the short and long term. This Review discusses the clinical complications of acute and chronic renal failure from a neurologic perspective, and highlights current understanding of the underlying pathophysiologies."
350,Clinical prediction models for progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage kidney failure under pre-dialysis nephrology care: results from the Chronic Kidney Disease Japan Cohort Study.,"Background: Reliable prediction tools are needed to identify patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at greater risk of developing end-stage kidney failure (ESKF). We developed and validated clinical prediction models (CPMs) for CKD progression to ESKF under pre-dialysis nephrology care using CKD-Japan Cohort (CKD-JAC) data. Methods: We prospectively followed up 2034 participants with CKD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, aged 20-75 years for a mean of 3.15 years. We randomly divided the overall analysis set into development and validation cohorts. In the development cohort, CPMs were developed using Cox proportional hazard regression, and the goodness of fit was evaluated. In the validation cohort, discrimination and calibration of the developed CPMs were evaluated. We also validated developed CPMs in the dataset with the bootstrap method. Results: ESKF onset was observed in 206 and 216 patients in the development (20.3%) and validation (21.2%) cohorts, respectively. Goodness of fit, discrimination, and calibration were worse for a simple model including age, sex, and eGFR than for a complicated model (plus albuminuria, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, serum albumin, and hemoglobin). The mean absolute difference between the observed and predictive probabilities of ESKF onset at 3 years was lower for the complicated model than for the simple model (1.57 vs. 1.87%). Conclusions: CPMs employing readily available data could precisely predict progression to ESKF in patients with CKD stage G3a to G5. These developed CPMs may facilitate more appropriate clinical care and shared decision-making between clinicians and patients."
351,Obesity and Kidney Disease: Hidden Consequences of the Epidemic.,"Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic, and its prevalence has been projected to grow by 40% in the next decade. This increasing prevalence has implications for the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and also for chronic kidney disease. A high body mass index is one of the strongest risk factors for new-onset chronic kidney disease. In individuals affected by obesity, a compensatory hyperfiltration occurs to meet the heightened metabolic demands of the increased body weight. The increase in intraglomerular pressure can damage the kidneys and raise the risk of developing chronic kidney disease in the long-term. The incidence of obesity-related glomerulopathy has increased 10-fold in recent years. Obesity has also been shown to be a risk factor for nephrolithiasis, and for a number of malignancies including kidney cancer. This year, the World Kidney Day promotes education on the harmful consequences of obesity and its association with kidney disease, advocating healthy lifestyle and health policy measures that make preventive behaviors an affordable option."
352,Kidney Disease in Oman: a View of the Current and Future Landscapes.,"Oman is located in the southeast of Arabian Peninsula with a relatively young population of about 3 831 553 people. The Ministry of Health, which is the healthcare provider, is facing a challenge with the increased levels of noncommunicable diseases including chronic kidney disease. A growing number of patients progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), demanding renal replacement therapy. In 2014, there were 1339 of ESKD patients receiving dialysis and almost 1400 patients received kidney transplants. The estimated annual incidence of ESKD is 120 patients per million population. Diabetes mellitus and hypertensive nephropathy are the commonly identified causes of ESKD. Many patients with glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, nephrolithiasis, and inherited kidney disease present with advanced chronic kidney disease. This article reviews the current status of kidney disease in Oman and addresses the present and future needs, through a systematic-review of all related papers."
353,Conservative Care of the Elderly CKD Patient: A Practical Guide.,"Palliative care is a branch of medicine dedicated to the relief of symptoms experienced during the course of illness. Renal palliative medicine or kidney supportive care is an evolving branch of nephrology, which incorporates the principles of palliative care into the care of CKD and ESRD (dialysis, transplant, and conservatively managed) patients. Conservative (non-dialytic) management is a legitimate option for frail, elderly CKD patients in whom dialysis may not lead to an improvement in quality or duration of life. Patients with advanced CKD have a high symptom burden that often worsens before death. Palliative or supportive care by visiting nurses, palliative care programs, or knowledgeable CKD programs should be routine for conservatively managed CKD patients. Decision-making about dialysis or conservative management requires patients and families be given information on prognosis, quality of life on dialysis, and options for supportive care. Advance care planning is the process by which these issues can be explored. In addition to advance care planning, because patients with ESRD have a high symptom burden, this needs to be addressed. Patients with ESRD have a high symptom burden, which needs to be addressed in any treatment plan. Common symptoms include pain, fatigue, insomnia, pruritus, anorexia, and nausea. Symptoms appear to increase as the patient nears death, and this must be anticipated. Recommendations for management are discussed in the article. Hospice care should be offered to all patients who are expected to die within the next 6 months, and supportive care should be provided to all CKD patients managed conservatively or with dialysis."
354,Pregnancy across the spectrum of chronic kidney disease.,"Management of the pregnant woman with chronic kidney disease is difficult for both nephrologists and obstetricians. Prepregnancy counselling with respect to risk stratification, optimization of maternal health prior to pregnancy, as well as management of the many potential pregnancy-associated complications in this complex patient population remains challenging due to the paucity of large, well-designed clinical studies. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of disease and the relative infrequency of pregnancy, particularly in more advanced stages of chronic kidney disease, leaves many clinicians feeling ill prepared to manage these pregnancies. As such, counselling is imprecise and management varies substantially across centers. All pregnancies in women with chronic kidney disease can benefit from a collaborative multidisciplinary approach with a team that consists of nephrologists experienced in the management of kidney disease in pregnancy, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, high-risk pregnancy nursing staff, dieticians, and pharmacists. Further access to skilled neonatologists and neonatal intensive care unit support is essential given the risks for preterm delivery in this patient population. The goal of this paper is to highlight some of the data that currently exist in the literature, provide management strategies for the practicing nephrologist at all stages of chronic kidney disease, and explore some of the knowledge gaps where future multinational collaborative research efforts should concentrate to improve pregnancy outcomes in women with kidney disease across the globe."
355,PCSK9 in chronic kidney disease.,"Purpose: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is accompanied by a number of secondary metabolic dysregulations, such as lipid abnormalities, presenting with unique characteristics. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have been introduced as the new era in the management of dyslipidemia with promising results in groups with refractory lipid abnormalities. Increasing number of studies investigate the possible association of PCSK9 levels with kidney function, especially with nephrotic range proteinuria, as well as its role as a prognostic cardiovascular risk marker in CKD. In this review, we discuss the existing evidence for PCSK9 levels in patient groups with nephrotic syndrome, non-dialysis CKD, end-stage renal disease and kidney transplantation. Methods: Online research was conducted in MEDLINE database to identify articles investigating PCSK9 in all different aspects of CKD. References from relevant studies were screened for supplementary articles. Results: Four cross-sectional studies, one secondary analysis, one publication from two independent cohort studies and one multicentre prospective cohort study assessed PCSK9 plasma levels in different subgroups of CKD patients. PCSK9 levels increase in nephrotic syndrome and have a positive correlation with proteinuria. In CKD patients, no correlation was found between PCSK9 levels and estimated GFR. Peritoneal dialysis patients have higher PCSK9 levels compared with hemodialysis and renal transplant patients as well as general population. Conclusion: Accumulative evidence focuses on the possible association of PCSK9 levels with kidney function. No data are available for the administration of PCSK9 inhibitors in CKD patients. Further research will optimize knowledge on the role of PCSK9 levels and PCSK9 inhibitors in CKD."
356,Risk prediction in chronic kidney disease: pitfalls and caveats.,"Purpose of review: This review aims to describe the challenges and highlight recent advances in the field of risk prediction for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We first focus on methods of model development and metrics of model performance in general, and then highlight important risk prediction tools for patients with CKD, for prediction of kidney failure and all-cause mortality. Recent findings: Investigators have used data from patients with CKD stages 1-5 and developed models for predicting the progression to kidney failure and all-cause mortality. Models for kidney failure have included estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, demographic and laboratory variables, and have achieved excellent discrimination. In contrast, model performance for prediction of all-cause mortality has been relatively modest. No validated models exist for predicting the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with CKD. Summary: Models for predicting kidney failure in patients with CKD are highly accurate and clinically usable. The kidney failure risk equation includes routinely collected laboratory data and can predict the progression of CKD to kidney failure with accuracy. Additional validation of the risk equation and development of new models for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD are needed."
357,Experiences of kidney failure: a qualitative meta-synthesis.,"The purpose of this study was to conduct a qualitative meta-synthesis on the experiences of kidney failure in the nursing literature. Database searches were not limited by date; however, only 13 peer-reviewed articles, theses, and dissertations met inclusion criteria. Meta-synthesis of the texts suggests individuals with kidney failure have experiences of paradoxical nature, including occurrences of restricted freedom that bring about distant connection, dependent autonomy, abnormal normalcy, and uncertain hope. When nurses are attuned to the seemingly contradictory nature of experiences of individuals living with kidney failure, they may be better able to develop strategies that will increase quality of life for these patients."
358,Nutrition and physical activity in CKD patients.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are at risk for protein-energy wasting, abnormal body composition and impaired physical capacity. These complications lead to increased risk of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality.In CKD patient as well as in healthy people, there is a close association between nutrition and physical activity. Namely, inadequate nutrient (energy) intake impairs physical performance thus favoring a sedentary lifestyle: this further contributes to loss of muscle strength and mass, which limit the quality of life and rehabilitation of CKD patients. In CKD as well as in end-stage-renal-disease patients, regular physical activity coupled with adequate energy and protein intake counteracts protein-energy wasting and related comorbidity and mortality. In summary, exercise training can positively influence nutritional status and the perception of well-being of CKD patients and may facilitate the anabolic effects of nutritional interventions."
359,The Kidney: An Organ in the Front Line of Oxidative Stress-Associated Pathologies.,"Both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are major causes of renal failure in humans and are associated with high incidences of morbidity and mortality rates. AKI and CKD are closely interconnected, and fueled by the obesity and diabetes epidemic, their prevalence is alarmingly increasing to the point that it currently represents a major heath issue worldwide. The kidney is an organ that is particularly sensitive to redox imbalance, resulting in excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress is viewed as a critical pathogenic factor implicated in the initiation, development, and progression of most renal diseases. This Forum discusses the redox-dependent factors and mechanisms accounting for the perturbation of renal function and circulation in the context of the major kidney pathologies linked to hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 25, 639-641."
360,Helping people to live well with chronic kidney disease.,"Reduced glomerular filtration rate and presence of albuminuria are both associated with increased risk of several poor outcomes. People with chronic kidney disease also commonly suffer from lower quality of life than their age-matched peers. The experiences reported by patients with chronic kidney disease include being shocked by the diagnosis, being uncertain about the cause and worrying about progression and future treatment. Issues such as depression, pain and fatigue are common in people with chronic kidney disease. Helping people to live well with a long-term condition like chronic kidney disease should include efforts to reduce the risk of adverse events occurring in the future, and consider what can be done to enhance quality of life now. Clinicians can help by being aware of the patient perspective, communicating clearly and recommending interventions that reduce future risk as well as recognising and treating symptoms. Assessing overall treatment burden is an important component of management and non-pharmacological interventions that may improve mobility, strength and pain should be considered."
361,Kidney Disease and Bone: Changing the Way We Look at Skeletal Health.,"Purpose of review: Kidney disease imparts profound skeletal changes, and unlike many other skeletal diseases, cortical bone is predominantly impacted. Significant advances in medical imaging have led to our ability to now obtain high-resolution three-dimensional views of cortical bone. This paper overviews recent work focused on cortical bone imaging, specifically cortical porosity, in kidney disease. Recent findings: Although a number of clinical papers have used high-resolution imaging to assess cortical bone porosity, the most impactful work involves longitudinal study designs that have assessed cortical porosity changes over time. These latter studies demonstrate dramatic increases in cortical porosity in untreated individuals and a lack of clear efficacy in reversing porosity with treatment (although data are limited). Those papers providing longitudinal assessment, both clinical and pre-clinical, reveal powerful data about cortical porosity and provide a foundation upon which future studies can build."
362,DNA Methylation Dysfunction in Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Renal disease is the common denominator of a number of underlying disease conditions, whose prevalence has been dramatically increasing over the last two decades. Two aspects are particularly relevant to the subject of this review: (I) most cases are gathered under the umbrella of chronic kidney disease since they require-predictably for several lustrums-continuous clinical monitoring and treatment to slow down disease progression and prevent complications; (II) cardiovascular disease is a terrible burden in this population of patients, in that it claims many lives yearly, while only a scant minority reach the renal disease end stage. Why indeed a review on DNA methylation and renal disease? As we hope to convince you, the present evidence supports the role of the existence of various derangements of the epigenetic control of gene expression in renal disease, which hold the potential to improve our ability, in the future, to more effectively act toward disease progression, predict outcomes and offer novel therapeutic approaches."
363,Simple renal cysts in the solitary kidney: Are they innocent in adult patients?,"In patients with a solitary kidney; residual renal volume is an important prognostic factor for kidney survival. At present, the impact of renal cysts on solitary kidney survival is not clear. The aim of this study is to examine the association of cysts on progression of renal failure in patients with a solitary kidney. Methods: This study included sixtyfive solitary kidney patients. The remaining kidneys after indication nephrectomy (IN) were evaluated with urinary system ultrasound. The primary outcome of the study is the progression of kidney failure during follow-up which was defined as: 25% decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and / or the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Results: The mean age of the patients was 55 ± 14 years and mean follow-up was 53 ± 27 months. Renal cysts were present in 30.7% of patients. 33.8 percent of patients had kidney disease progression and 10.7 % required RRT. Those with progressive disease were older (61 ± 13, 52 ± 14; P = 0.011), had lower baseline GFR (30 ± 11, 39 ± 18; P = 0.035), higher proteiuria (2.84 ± 0.58, 2.47 ± 0.57; P = 0.031) and frequently harboring cysts in the solitary kidney (52.3%, 20.4%; P = 0.006). Progression to kidney failure and RRT requirement in cases with or without renal cysts was (60% vs. 22%; P = 0.004) and (20% vs. 6.6%; P = 0.123), respectively. Acquired cysts in solitary kidney was independently associated with progression to kidney failure and RRT respectively (Exp(B) 3.173; P = 0.01 and Exp(B) 12.35; P = 0.04). Conclusion: Simple renal cysts in solitary kidney patients with impaired renal function is associated with poor renal outcome. Large-scale studies are needed to clarify this issue."
364,Integrating risk prediction models into chronic kidney disease care.,"Purpose of review: Although the concept of risk prediction in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not new, how to integrate risk prediction models into CKD care remains largely unknown, particularly in the prevention and early management of CKD. The present review presents a timely overview of recent CKD risk prediction models and conceptualizes how these may be integrated into the care of patients with CKD. Recent findings: In recent literature, prediction of time-to-ESKD has been thoroughly validated in multiple international cohorts, new models focused on CKD incidence, morbidity, and mortality have been developed, and ongoing work will determine the impact of integrating risk prediction models into CKD care on patients, nephrologists, and health systems. Summary: With the availability of new models focused on CKD incidence, the United States Preventive Task Force should reconsider its determination of insufficient evidence for primary screening of CKD, which was due in part to the absence of validated risk models to guide CKD screening. Models predicting CKD morbidity and mortality present a new opportunity to standardize the intensity and frequency of care across nephrology practices."
365,Delayed Consequences of Acute Kidney Injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an increasingly common complication of hospitalization and acute illness. Experimental data indicate that AKI may cause permanent kidney damage through tubulointerstitial fibrosis and progressive nephron loss, while also lowering the threshold for subsequent injury. Furthermore, preclinical data suggest that AKI may also cause distant organ dysfunction. The extension of these findings to human studies suggests long-term consequences of AKI including, but not limited to recurrent AKI, progressive kidney disease, elevated blood pressure, cardiovascular events, and mortality. As the number of AKI survivors increases, the need to better understand the mechanisms driving these processes becomes paramount. Optimizing care for AKI survivors will require understanding the short- and long-term risks associated with AKI, identifying patients at highest risk for poor outcomes, and testing interventions that target modifiable risk factors. In this review, we examine the literature describing the association between AKI and long-term outcomes and highlight opportunities for further research and potential intervention."
366,Chronic Kidney Disease in New Zealand Maori and Pacific People.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects Māori (the indigenous people of New Zealand [NZ]) as well as Pacific people, particularly from Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji. As New Zealand is home to the largest population of Pacific people, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands fulfil the definition of a CKD 'hotspot'. Although diabetic nephropathy is the major cause of CKD, with disproportionately higher rates in NZ Māori and Pacific people, there is increasing evidence that there is a familial predisposition to CKD that is not due to diabetes. Further studies are required to understand the reasons for this pre-disposition."
367,Cost-effective treatment modalities for reducing morbidity associated with chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide health problem with increasing prevalence and incidence. Guidelines suggest that early referral to a nephrologist to manage advanced stage (4+) patients with CKD is an effective treatment strategy, with earlier stage patients best managed through primary care physicians. Should patients with CKD progress to total kidney failure, several therapies are available that vary widely in costs. Kidney transplantation offers the lowest costs and highest quality of life, followed in ascending order of costs by peritoneal dialysis, home hemodialysis and facility-based hemodialysis. Earlier detection of CKD may prevent progression to kidney failure, and accurate risk prediction of end-stage kidney failure may improve clinical planning, outcomes and resource allocation."
368,Obstructive sleep apnea and chronic kidney disease.,"Purpose of review: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The relationship between OSA and CKD is likely to be bi-directional. On one hand, the presence of OSA leads to intermittent hypoxia, sympathetic nervous system activity, and hypertension, all of which may have deleterious effects on kidney function. On the other hand, in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), intensification of renal replacement therapy has been shown to attenuate sleep apnea severity, suggesting that the renal disease itself contributes to the pathogenesis of OSA. The present review describes our current understanding of the bi-directional relationship between OSA and CKD. Recent findings: Studies suggest that the presence of OSA and nocturnal hypoxia may lead to worsening of kidney function. One potential mechanism is activation of the renin-angiotensin system by OSA, an effect which may be attenuated by CPAP therapy. In ESRD, fluid overload plays an important role in the pathogenesis of OSA and fluid removal by ultrafiltration leads to marked improvements in sleep apnea severity. Summary: OSA is associated with accelerated loss of kidney function. In patients with ESRD, fluid overload plays an important role in the pathogenesis of OSA."
369,Dyslipidemia in patients with chronic kidney disease: etiology and management.,"The worldwide population is burdened with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from 10-13 %. Patients with CKD subsequently die to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and their complications. In the Czech population, in 2016, the number of patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on regular dialytic treatment was 6 739, or 674/1 000 000 inhabitants. Overall mortality in regular dialysis treatment patients was 18.4 % in 2016, of which 43 % died of cardiovascular complications. In view of this fact, a number of expert groups are concerned, among other things, with the problems of lipid metabolism disorders, with the aim of finding a common predictive marker (preferably also therapeutically qualifiable) to stratify patients dialyzed or potentially indicating hypolipidemic therapy. The aim of possible interventions is to minimize cardiovascular risk and subsequent complications resulting from cardiovascular disease (CVD), thus improving the quality of life of regular dialysis treatment patients."
370,Kidney failure and the gut: p-cresol and the dangers from within.,"Previously, uremic toxins were sometimes regarded as a large, mysterious, but also anonymous group of factors potentially contributing to morbidity and mortality in end-stage renal disease. By identifying the protein-bound solute p-cresol as a risk factor for mortality in dialysis patients, Bammens and colleagues for the first time present evidence of a clinically relevant uremic toxin in relation to clinical outcome."
371,Renal failure caused by drugs.,"Renal failure affects the body's water-electrolyte balance. It is considered to be acute when it occurs abruptly, in a matter of hours or days. It is considered to be chronic when it lasts more than three months. Drugs are among the many causes of both acute and chronic renal failure. Their detrimental effects on the kidneys are often predictable and avoidable. Patients must be screened for risk factors, and standard rules for protecting and monitoring renal function must be followed."
372,Hypertension in renal failure.,"Hypertension is a common component of the morbidity associated with renal failure. The mechanisms that contribute to high blood pressure are reviewed in this section. Also covered are therapies to reduce hypertension, the treatment goals of those therapies, and the outcomes of antihypertensive therapy on kidney function in patients with renal failure. Various antihypertensive agents are specifically addressed, and a treatment paradigm is presented for combination antihypertensive drug therapy, which is usually necessary in the antihypertensive therapy of patients with renal failure."
373,"[The detection of chronic kidney disease, a caregiver-user collaboration].","For several years, the university hospital of Toulouse has been regularly collaborating with the France Rein association to organise a kidney failure screening day. A multidisciplinary team made up of student nurses, nurses, dieticians, nephrologists and volunteers from the association, work with hospital users to improve the prevention and treatment of people with kidney failure. This approach is a real public health action."
374,The concept of acute kidney injury and the RIFLE criteria.,"Over last half century, the concept of acute renal failure has evolved and with it our estimates of the incidence, prevalence and mortality. Indeed, until very recently no standard definition of acute renal failure was available, and this lack of a common language created confusion and made comparisons all but impossible. In response to the need for a common definition and classification of acute renal failure, the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative group of experts developed and published a set of consensus criteria for defining and classifying acute renal failure. These criteria which make up acronym 'RIFLE' classify renal dysfunction according to the degree of impairment present: risk (R), injury (I), and failure (F), sustained loss (L) and end-stage kidney disease (E). However, as these criteria were developed, a new concept immerged. Renal dysfunction was no longer only considered significant when it reached the stage of failure, but a spectrum from early risk to long-term failure was recognized and codified. Subsequent studies have validated these criteria in various populations and have shown that relatively mild dysfunction is associated with adverse outcomes. The term acute kidney injury has subsequently been proposed to distinguish this new concept from the older terminology of failure."
375,Magnesium Balance in Chronic and End-Stage Kidney Disease.,"This article explores the effects of CKD and end-stage kidney disease on magnesium balance. In CKD, there is decreased glomerular filtration of magnesium. Decreased tubular reabsorption can compensate to a degree, but once CKD stage 4 is reached there is a tendency toward hypermagnesemia. In dialysis, magnesium balance is dependent on the constituents of the dialysate that the blood is exposed to. The concentration of dialysate magnesium is just one of the factors that need to be considered. During transplantation, there are particular effects of immunosuppressants that can affect the magnesium balance and need to be considered by the clinician."
376,The kidney effects of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients are at risk for acute kidney disease and CKD, which confer excess morbidity and mortality in this patient population. A main cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in stem cell recipients is prerenal azotemia, but acute tubular necrosis (ATN), obstruction, marrow transfusion toxicity, and hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome also contribute. AKI is an important risk factor for death and CKD among HSCT survivors. CKD is a growing complication of HSCT as more patients are transplanted and survival improves. For most patients, the exact etiology of CKD is never identified, but graft vs host disease and thrombotic microangiopathy are important diagnoses to consider. Stem cell transplant patient survival on dialysis is generally poor, but kidney transplantation is a safe and reasonable option for HSCT recipients who progress to ESRD."
377,Shaping Public Health Initiatives in Kidney Diseases: The Peer Kidney Care Initiative.,"Background: While broad-based societal efforts to improve public health have targeted disorders such as cardiovascular disease and cancer for several decades, efforts devoted to kidney disease have developed only more recently. The Peer Kidney Care Initiative, a novel effort designed to address knowledge gaps in the care of patients with kidney disease, examines key disease processes, the roles of geography and seasonality on outcomes, and longitudinal trends in outcomes over time. Summary: Admissions for gastrointestinal bleeds increased approximately 28% between 2004 and 2011 in prevalent patients. Infection with Clostridium difficile increased nearly 70% between 2003 and 2010 in patients within a year of initiation. Admissions for heart failure in prevalent patients decreased approximately 25% between 2004 and 2012, but admissions for volume overload increased a nearly equal amount. Incidence rates varied substantially by geographic region, such that unadjusted rates in the highest region were nearly double than those in the lowest. There was seasonal variation in all-cause mortality of approximately 15-20% in both incident and prevalent patients, suggesting a link between cardiovascular events and seasonally related environmental conditions. New cases of end-stage renal disease fell from 385 per million population in 2003 to 344 in 2012, a decline of approximately 10%. Key messages: Peer complements existing kidney disease epidemiologic efforts by examining specific actionable disease entities, exploring geographic variation in care, highlighting the role of seasonality on outcomes, and emphasizing the importance of trending outcomes over time as overall societal progress is being made."
378,"Acute kidney injury-epidemiology, outcomes and economics.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a widespread problem of epidemic status. Compelling evidence indicates that the incidence of AKI is rapidly increasing, particularly among hospitalized patients with acute illness and those undergoing major surgery. This increase might be partially attributable to greater recognition of AKI, improved ascertainment in administrative data and greater sensitivity of consensus diagnostic and classification schemes. Other causes could be an ageing population, increasing incidences of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and an expanding characterization of modifiable risk factors, such as sepsis, administration of contrast media and exposure to nephrotoxins. The sequelae of AKI are severe and characterized by increased risk of short-term and long-term mortality, incident CKD and accelerated progression to end-stage renal disease. AKI-associated mortality is decreasing, but remains unacceptably high. Moreover, the absolute number of patients dying as a result of AKI is increasing as the incidence of the disorder increases, and few proven effective preventative or therapeutic interventions exist. Survivors of AKI, particularly those who remain on renal replacement therapy, often have reduced quality of life and consume substantially greater health-care resources than the general population as a result of longer hospitalizations, unplanned intensive care unit admissions and rehospitalizations."
379,Ferric Citrate in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Ferric citrate (FC) is an iron-containing phosphate binder that has been shown to effectively decrease serum phosphate, increase hemoglobin, and replete iron stores in patients with chronic kidney disease. Intestinal absorption of iron from FC results in increases in serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation, effects that occur over 12 to 24 weeks and subsequently appear to plateau. As a result, use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and intravenous iron is reduced significantly and in clinical trials in patients receiving hemodialysis, the majority of subjects were able to discontinue intravenous iron use completely. One-year safety data have indicated that FC-treated subjects have reduced rates of hospitalization and reduced serious adverse events related to gastrointestinal, infectious, and cardiovascular causes, although the mechanism for this finding is unclear. The large doses of oral iron administered and lack of precise information on relative absorption over time or on the potential effect of FC on intestinal epithelial function should prompt continued clinical investigation. Although not yet approved for use in the United States for patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease, FC is a welcome addition to the available treatment options for decreasing phosphate concentrations. The multifaceted favorable effects on anemia and phosphate in combination with the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent and intravenous iron-sparing data support the use of FC as a first-line treatment option when phosphate-decreasing therapy is indicated."
380,Particular aspects of gastroenterological disorders in chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease patients: a clinically focused review.,"Besides renal disease, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are frequently reported in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Related gastrointestinal symptoms tend to increase as the renal disease progresses. Also, in patients with ESRD, the modality of dialysis is related to particular forms of GI disorders.The kidney can interact with the digestive organs through functional endogenous systems such as the 'kidney-colon axis' and the 'kidney-liver axis'. Digestive diseases are one of the visible manifestations of the disturbance between hemostatic, hemodynamic and immunological balance in such patients.No clear management guidelines currently exist for many of the gastrointestinal problems that accompany renal failure. This review aims to describe the particular aspects of GI diseases present in CKD/ESRD. We focus our discussion in the specificities of epidemiology, diagnosis, and prognosis of such disorders between the different segments of the digestive system."
381,[Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease in children].,慢性肾脏病是指各种原因引起的慢性肾脏结构或功能异常，持续时间超过3个月，并且影响患者健康，最终可进展至终末期肾脏病。儿童慢性肾脏病的有效防治需参考发病率和患病率等流行病学资料。本综述重点介绍儿童慢性肾脏病及其导致终末期肾病（或慢性肾衰竭）的发病率、患病率、病死率、肾脏替代治疗率及病因学的研究进展。.
382,Fibrotic Changes Mediating Acute Kidney Injury to Chronic Kidney Disease Transition.,"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is common, costly, and it results from progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). ESRD claims many lives every year. It is increasingly recognized that episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) predispose to the future development of CKD and ESRD. While our understanding of the pathophysiology of the AKI to CKD transition is improving, there are no validated therapeutic strategies to prevent this transition. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in defining the cellular and molecular events underlying the AKI to CKD transition and highlight potential therapeutic targets and strategies to reduce the incidence of CKD following AKI."
383,Pregnancy in advanced chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.,"Purpose of review: This article reviews the available literature about the incidence, outcomes, and the management of pregnancy in women with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who require renal replacement therapy. Recent findings: Pregnancy in women with advanced CKD and ESRD can result in serious adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, but improved outcomes have been noted in recent years, likely secondary to intensified dialysis regimens. More intensive dialysis allows for the gentle removal of water, solutes, and uremic toxins, which theoretically results in near-normal maternal renal physiology, an improvement in placental blood flow, and therefore a better environment for fetal growth and development. As management remains complex, a close joint collaboration between the high-risk obstetrical team and nephrology is essential. Summary: Pregnancy on dialysis is becoming a viable option for women with advanced CKD and ESRD who do not have immediate access to transplantation."
384,Metabolic Enzyme System and Transport Pathways in Chronic Kidney Diseases.,"Background: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), a global public health problem, affects numerous people worldwide, and the prevalence is rising. Results from animal experiments and clinical investigations have demonstrated that drug metabolic enzymes and transporters-mediated non-renal clearance are dramatically impaired in CKD, co-respondent with alterations in the elimination of metabolized drugs. Accumulated uremic toxins may downregulate or directly inhibit the activity and/or the expression of drug metabolic enzymes and transporters, which may result in unintended alterations of drug exposure and response in cases when drugs dose are not adjusted for the renal dysfunction. Method: The aim of this review is to highlight the impact of CKD on non-renal drug clearance involving metabolism enzyme system and transport pathways, and to provide insight into the impact of non-renal drug clearance on drug metabolism and distribution in CKD patients. Results: Metabolic enzyme system and transport pathways are dysregulated in both rats and humans with renal failure. Conclusion: The alterations of drug metabolic enzymes and transporters in the kidney, liver, and intestine play an important role in their pharmacokinetic changes, and thus, the metabolism and transportation of many medications used to treat CKD patients may be affected."
385,Left ventricular hypertrophy and progression of chronic kidney disease.,"Reduced glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria do not account for the total risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD), suggesting that other factors might be involved in progressive renal function worsening. Among these, cardiovascular disease, even subclinical, could play a role. The role of left ventricular hypertrophy in this setting is reviewed in light of recent reports that showed that it is associated with faster progression of renal disease to ESRD requiring dialysis, in both hypertensive and chronic kidney disease patients."
386,Valvular heart disease in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Valvular heart disease (VHD) is common in patients with impaired renal function, especially in those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing dialysis. Progressive sclerosis and calcification of the valves and valvular annuli are major components of the etiology. These processes typically affect the aortic and mitral valve and can lead to both valvular insufficiency and stenosis. As recommended by the 2017 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of VHD, surgical treatment remains the standard care for most cases of severe VHD. However, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased mortality when compared with patients with preserved renal function. Interventional treatment options have emerged as an effective and safe alternative for patients older than 75 years and/or with increased surgical risk. Consequently, in patients with CKD at increased surgical risk who have suitable anatomical morphology, transcatheter replacement and/or repair should be discussed in the interdisciplinary ""heart team."""
387,[Acute kidney injury after hematopoietic cell transplantation].,"Stem cell transplantation is now a routine and successful therapeutic method in many hematopoietic disorders and cancers. Unfortunately, toxicity of the procedure significantly worsens the outcomes, with acute and chronic kidney injury among the others. Etiology of kidney failure is multifactorial with nephrotoxicity of drugs, septic complications, sinusoidal occlusion syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy and acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Understanding these syndromes enables early recognition and proper intervention that can reduce incidence and severity of kidney injury and improve outcomes."
388,[Cardiorenal syndromes].,"Cardiac and kidney diseases are very common, and increasingly coexist. Classification for cardiorenal syndrome and for its specific subtypes has been developed and published recently by a consensus group of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative. Cardiorenal syndromes have been classified according to whether the impairment of each organ is primary, secondary or whether heart and kidney dysfunction occurs simultaneously as a systemic disease. The different syndromes were classified into five subtypes. Type-1: acute cardiorenal syndrome: an abrupt worsening of cardiac function leading to acute kidney injury and/or dysfunction. Type-2: chronic cardiorenal syndrome: chronic abnormalities in cardiac function causing kidney injury and/or dysfunction. Type-3: acute renocardiac syndrome: abrupt worsening of kidney function leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction. Type-4: chronic renocardiac syndrome: chronic kidney diseases leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction. Type-5: secondary cardiorenal syndrome: acute or chronic systemic diseases leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney. The identification of patients and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying each syndrome subtype will help cardiologists, nephrologists and physicians working on intensive care units to characterize groups of their patients with cardiac and renal impairment and to provide a more accurate treatment for them."
389,Intersection of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease: atrial fibrillation.,"Purpose of review: Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia in patients with kidney disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the burden of atrial fibrillation in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), postulate possible mechanisms to explain this burden of disease, understand the clinical consequences of atrial fibrillation and review the treatment options for atrial fibrillation specific to patients with kidney disease. Recent findings: Recent literature has revealed that the clinical multiorgan impact of atrial fibrillation in patients with CKD and ESRD is substantial. Although novel oral anticoagulants to treat atrial fibrillation and prevent associated complications have been tested in large trials in the general population, there is a paucity of data on the efficacy and safety of these agents in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. Summary: Atrial fibrillation is a significant comorbidity in patients with CKD and ESRD with important prognostic implications. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms that contribute to the disproportionate burden of this arrhythmia in patients with kidney disease and in to treatment options specific to this population of high-risk patients."
390,Managing chronic kidney disease in diabetes patients with the latest chemical therapies.,"Introduction: During the years, while treatment strategy for diabetes mellitus has improved, the incidence of diabetes worldwide increases continuously. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the major diabetic microvascular complications, and a primary cause leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The progression to ESRD, affected by hyperglycemia and hypertension, is characterized by microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria. With advances in understanding the pathogenesis of CKD in diabetic patients, many novel therapeutic targets have been proposed, and the corresponding agents are being developed continually to prevent the progression of CKD. Areas covered: This review focuses on those tested in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of CKD in diabetic patients, including renin-angiotensin system blockers, aldosterone antagonists, calcium channel blockers, TGF-β inhibitors, protein kinase C inhibitors, advanced glycation end products inhibitors, GLP-1 analogues, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists, and so on. Expert commentary: The ideal control of glucose and blood pressure and healthy lifestyle are prerequisite for diabetic patients, despite the progression of CKD is inevitable. Over the last few years, several agents have been developed to delay and even reverse progression of CKD in diabetic patients."
391,Decision-making in patients with cancer and kidney disease.,"Thoughtful decision-making in a patient with cancer and kidney disease requires a comprehensive discussion of prognosis and therapy options for both conditions framed by the individual's preferences and goals of care. An estimate of overall prognosis is generated that includes the patient's clinical presentation and parameters associated with adverse outcomes, such as age, performance status, frailty, malnutrition, and comorbidities. Empathic communication of this information using a shared decision-making approach can lead to an informed decision that respects patient autonomy and is consistent with the patient's ""big-picture"" goals and personal values."
392,[When and how to talk about living donation with a kidney failure patient ?].,"When and how to talk about living donation with a kidney failure patient? Living donation is often an uneasy subject to which kidney failure patients are confronted: donation is frequently misrepresented and is object of a certain societal mistrust, making it difficult for the clinician to talk about it to patients. These obstacles can be overcome if living donation is brought up early on in the clinical course especially in the presence of the patient's family. A collegial and transparent information with a focus on demystifying misrepresentations and description of the benefits for the recipient and the donor will facilitate access to this life-changing treatment option."
393,Current status of dietary measures in patients with advanced-stage chronic renal failure.,"For patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) appropriately chosen and timely initiated dietary measures, as a complement to drug therapy, may slow the progression of the disease and delay the need for dialysis treatment. According to the results, dietary protein restriction may play a very important in management of such a patient. The effect of low protein diet is given by the early initiation and well cooperation of patients. The low protein diet with supplementation of ketoanalogues of amino acids is an attractive intervention to help maintain good nutritional status of patients and also have a positive role in calcium phosphate metabolism. Depending on the level of CKD´s progression it should not be forgotten either the fluid balance and the limitation of the intake of salt and phosphorus in the diet which may also have an unfortunate effect on the course of the disease."
394,Management of chronic kidney disease in the elderly.,"Both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease are strongly age related. Although the morbidity and mortality of CKD have significantly improved in recent years because of a greater understanding of its pathophysiology and evidence-based approach to management, the application of this evidence to the elderly CKD patients is often fraught with difficulty. This is because, besides age, the clinical and biological variables that are widely prevalent in the elderly, such as multiple co-morbidities, functional impairments and polypharmacy, and quality of life and functional outcome measures, which are pertinent to this age group, have generally not been incorporated into the available evidence. This paper reviews the current evidence with a view to providing a framework for diagnosing and managing CKD in the elderly. Special references are made to age-related physiological changes in the renal system, assessment of renal function, and management of metabolic complications and end-stage renal disease."
395,Adolescents and Young Adults with Chronic or End-Stage Kidney Disease.,"Background: Adolescents and young adults face unique and complex physical, psychological, and family challenges. Despite improvements in care for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), long-term mortality for children, adolescents, and young adults with CKD remains substantially higher than their healthy counterparts. Summary: In this article, we discuss the complex challenges that adolescent and young adult CKD/ESKD patients face. Adolescents have different CKD etiologies and progress along a course dissimilar to the adult population, but have similar multifarious comorbidities. In the setting of puberty and learning to become self-sufficient, adolescence is a critical time for growth and psychosocial development. Physiological complications of CKD underlie many of the long-term outcomes. CKD-mineral and bone disorder and anemia are particularly challenging given that they are exacerbated by the rapid growth of adolescents. Endocrine imbalances and malnutrition can delay and limit growth. All of these factors, together with family dynamics and socioeconomic status, contribute to the poor long-term outcomes and decreased quality of life (QoL) for these patients and their families. Key messages: Care for the adolescent CKD/ESKD population is uniquely challenging, but research has identified ways in which we can continue to improve long-term outcomes and QoL for adolescents with CKD/ESKD."
396,Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. A debilitating disease causing fibrosis of the skin and inner organs in patients with kidney failure.,"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a rare and debilitating disease which affects patients with kidney failure. The most obvious manifestation is fibrosis of the skin, but it also frequently involves the locomotor system and the inner organs. An association has been found with the administration of gadolinium-containing contrast agents, which are given to provide enhanced contrast during magnetic resonance imaging. It is thought that unstable chelate complexes release toxic gadolinium. Other triggers or co-triggers may also be relevant. No effective treatment currently exists for NSF, so prevention of the disease is of the utmost importance. If gadolinium-containing contrast agents need to be administered to patients who have kidney failure, a cyclic agent should be used, and the dosage should be as low as possible. Although no proof is yet available that hemodialysis prevents NSF, it is effective in the clearance of gadolinium and should therefore be considered as a treatment immediately after the imaging."
397,"Chronic kidney disease in older people: physiology, pathology or both?","The global population is aging due to a reduction in youthful deaths and an extension of the later stages of life. With aging comes a decline in the physiologic functions of various organs and systems. Vascular aging is associated with structural and functional changes of the arterial wall leading to loss of elasticity and compliance. Renal vasculature is not spared as aging is associated with arterial, arteriolar and capillary, glomerular changes (glomerulosclerosis). It is likely that age-related vascular changes are linked to the decline in renal function observed with aging. These changes occur at varying stages of aging depending on predisposing genetic factors and associated life course exposure to cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension and diabetes. The decline in renal function with 'normal' aging in the absence of associated progressive cardiovascular disease is slow and does not seem to be of major clinical significance. The current definition of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including microalbuminuria, and the method of estimation of glomerular filtration rate have inadvertently resulted in an exaggerated prevalence of CKD in the elderly. This is combined with the fact that most of the studies showing decline in renal function with aging are limited by the absence of a correction for associated comorbid confounding factors, resulting in difficulty separating the effect of physiological aging on kidney function from pathological aging due to comorbidities. Such a correction is difficult, if not impossible, to objectively construct. We suggest that only those fractions of older patients with underlying progressive vascular pathology likely to involve the kidneys will, in the future, warrant attention to reduce vascular risk and the associated kidney damage."
398,"The epidemic of cardio-vascular disease in renal failure: where does it come from, where do we go?","Cardio-vascular disease and death are among the most important medical and socio-economic challenges of the 21st century. Renal failure, a major medical problem per se, gives rise to an accelerated and strongly magnified model of atherogenesis and vascular damage. Already with a minor decrease in renal function, coronary and vascular risk are increased and play a role next to classical risk factors such as male gender, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia or smoking. The impact of renal failure on cardio-vascular risk remains present even after correction for these traditional risk factors. This suggests that factors specifically related to renal failure play a role. Atheromatosis is currently considered as an inflammatory disorder. Renal failure gives rise to enhanced inflammatory parameters. However, the atherogenic factors related to this inflammation remain largely unknown. Hence, the condition of renal failure may be helpful to answer this question. According to recent data from the USA, close to 5% of the general population (11% of those older than 65 without diabetes or hypertension) has a renal function which is decreased by at least 50%, but other analyses come up with even higher figures. Better identification of the factors at play in this population, optimized secondary preventive actions similar to those applied in diabetics, and timely screening and therapy will be helpful to improve quality of life and reduce socio-economic burden in this population."
399,[Renal toxicity of lithium].,"Besides its efficiency, lithium has a narrow therapeutic index and can result in considerable toxicity. Among the potential side effects, two types of renal toxicity are observed: a decreased renal concentrating ability and a chronic renal failure. Lithium-induced polyuria is frequent, estimated to affect up to 40% of patients, and develops usually early. It may be irreversible, especially if the treatment has been prescribed for more than 15 years. A chronic renal failure is observed in patients treated for more than 10 to 20 years. Its prevalence is estimated at 12% after 19 years of treatment. Some patients (0.5%) may reach end stage renal disease. The major risk factor is the duration of exposure to lithium. Discussion about stopping or not lithium in case of renal failure needs multidisciplinary expertise and depends on psychiatric status and renal function."
400,Intradialytic Hypoxemia in Chronic Hemodialysis Patients.,"When kidney failure occurs, patients are at risk for fluid overload states, which can cause pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and upper airway obstruction. Kidney disease is also associated with impaired respiratory function, as in central sleep apnea or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Hence, respiratory and renal diseases are frequently coexisting. Hypoxemia is the terminal pathway of a multitude of respiratory pathologies. The measurement of oxygen saturation (SO2) is a basic and commonly used tool in clinical practice. Both arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) can be easily obtained in hemodialysis (HD) patients, SaO2 from an arteriovenous access and ScvO2 from a central catheter. Here, we give a brief overview of the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system, and the different technologies that are currently available to measure oxygen status in dialysis patients. We then focus on literature regarding intradialytic SaO2 and ScvO2. Lastly, we present clinical vignettes of intradialytic drops in SaO2 and ScvO2 in association with different symptoms and clinical scenarios with an emphasis on the pathophysiology of these cases. Given the fact that in the general population hypoxemia is associated with adverse outcomes, including increased mortality, cardiac arrhythmias and cardiovascular events, we posit that intradialytic SO2 may serve as a potential marker to identify HD patients at increased risk for morbidity and mortality."
401,[Frailty in chronic kidney disease].,"The prevalence of frailty is very high in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and increases with its severity. A number of factors associated with chronic renal insufficiency appear to favor the frequent occurrence of frailty in these patients. In addition to its unfavorable impact on the quality of life, morbidity and mortality, frailty is an important criterion in setting treatment goals for chronic kidney disease as well as in the decision whether to undergo dialysis treatment or conservative treatment without dialysis and also in listing a patient for a kidney transplantation. There is still uncertainty about the measures to improve the effects of frailty in patients with chronic kidney insufficiency. These can vary considerably depending on the stage and course of the kidney disease and external circumstances. Individual physical, psychological or emotional problems can be identified on the basis of a geriatric assessment including a social anamnesis. This forms the foundation for tailored measures, such as advice on how to behave when suffering from kidney disease, training therapy and rehabilitation. Patients with renal insufficiency seem to benefit from the latter to a similar extent as patients without kidney disease. Thus, an early assessment of frailty-associated problems in patients with chronic renal insufficiency could help to identify deficits as soon as possible and, by measures adapted to the situation, to achieve an improvement in the quality of life and/or prognosis of these patients."
402,Cardiovascular Disease Consequences of CKD.,"Chronic kidney disease, defined as reduced glomerular filtration rate (estimated using serum creatinine- and/or serum cystatin C-based equations) or excess urinary protein excretion, affects approximately 13% of adult Americans and is linked to a variety of clinical complications. Although persons with end-stage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis therapy experience a substantially high cardiovascular burden, whether mild-to-moderate chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events has been more controversial. This review evaluates the current evidence about the clinical and subclinical cardiovascular consequences associated with chronic kidney disease of varying levels of severity. In addition, it discusses the predictors of adverse cardiovascular outcomes while also focusing on recent insights into the relationships between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study, a large current prospective cohort study of adults from across the spectrum of chronic kidney disease."
403,[Attaching importance to sepsis-induced acute kidney injury after burn].,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after severe burn, which portends a worse prognosis. Sepsis is the leading etiology of late AKI after severe burn. The pathogenesis of sepsis-induced AKI remains incompletely understood. Although there have been numerous preventive and therapeutic measures evaluated for sepsis-induced AKI, the precise and available intervention in sepsis-induced AKI after burn has yet to be defined."
404,The Potential Role of Catheter-Based Renal Sympathetic Denervation in Chronic and End-Stage Kidney Disease.,"Sympathetic activation is a hallmark of chronic and end-stage renal disease and adversely affects cardiovascular prognosis. Hypertension is present in the vast majority of these patients and plays a key role in the progressive deterioration of renal function and the high rate of cardiovascular events in this patient cohort. Augmentation of renin release, tubular sodium reabsorption, and renal vascular resistance are direct consequences of efferent renal sympathetic nerve stimulation and the major components of neural regulation of renal function. Renal afferent nerve activity directly influences sympathetic outflow to the kidneys and other highly innervated organs involved in blood pressure control via hypothalamic integration. Renal denervation of the kidney has been shown to reduce blood pressure in many experimental models of hypertension. Targeting the renal nerves directly may therefore be specifically useful in patients with chronic and end-stage renal disease. In this review, we will discuss the potential role of catheter-based renal denervation in patients with impaired kidney function and also reflect on the potential impact on other cardiovascular conditions commonly associated with chronic kidney disease such as heart failure and arrhythmias."
405,Cardiovascular disease in children with chronic kidney disease.,"More than a decade ago, cardiovascular disease (CVD) was recognized as a major cause of death in children with advanced CKD. This observation has sparked the publication of multiple studies assessing cardiovascular risk, mechanisms of disease, and early markers of CVD in this population. Similar to adults, children with CKD have an extremely high prevalence of traditional and uremia-related CVD risk factors. Early markers of cardiomyopathy, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction, and early markers of atherosclerosis, such as increased carotid artery intima-media thickness, carotid arterial wall stiffness, and coronary artery calcification, are frequently present in these children, especially those on maintenance dialysis. As a population without preexisting symptomatic cardiac disease, children with CKD potentially receive significant benefit from aggressive attempts to prevent and treat CVD. Early CKD, before needing dialysis, is the optimal time to both identify modifiable risk factors and intervene in an effort to avert future CVD. Slowing the progression of CKD, avoiding long-term dialysis and, if possible, conducting preemptive transplantation may represent the best strategies to decrease the risk of premature cardiac disease and death in children with CKD."
406,Molecular mechanisms of disorders of lipid metabolism in chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition marked by protracted kidney damage which over time can lead to end stage renal disease (ESRD). CKD can be categorized into different stages based on the extent of renal damage and degree of renal dysfunction with ESRD requiring renal replacement therapy considered the final stage. It is important to note that CKD in all of its forms is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, cardiovascular (CV) disease and poor CV outcomes. While a number of factors contribute to the high risk of CV mortality in this patient population, dyslipidemia is considered to be a key player in the pathogenesis of CV disease in CKD. Molecular mechanisms responsible for CKD-associated lipid disorders are unique and greatly influenced by the stage of renal disease, presence and degree of proteinuria and in patients with ESRD, modality of renal replacement therapy. This article provides a detailed overview of the molecular mechanisms which cause dyslipidemia and the nature of lipid disorders associated with CKD and ESRD."
407,Indian chronic kidney disease study: Design and methods.,"Aim: The rate and factors that influence progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in developing countries like India are unknown. A pan-country prospective, observational cohort study is needed to address these knowledge gaps. Methods: The Indian Chronic Kidney Disease (ICKD) study will be a cohort study of approximately 5000 patients with mild to moderate CKD presenting to centres that represent different geographical regions in India. Time to 50% decline in baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, need of renal replacement therapy or any new cardiovascular disease (CVD) event or death from CVD are the primary end points. Value of study: This study will provide the opportunity to determine risk factors for CKD progression and development of CVD in Indian subjects and perform international comparisons to determine ethnic and geographical differences. A bio-repository will provide a chance to discover biomarkers and explore genetic risk factors."
408,"Estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria: diagnosis, staging, and prognosis.","Purpose of review: To describe the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and important outcomes for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The first part of the review presents the evidence linking eGFR and albuminuria to important clinical outcomes, and the second part highlights the importance of these risk relationships across multiple subgroups and in clinical risk prediction. Recent findings: Investigators have used data from large population-based cohort studies and conducted collaborative meta-analyses to definitively establish the relationship between eGFR, albuminuria, and adverse clinical outcomes. Recent systematic reviews have also highlighted the importance of these variables in predicting the risk of kidney failure and all-cause mortality. Summary: eGFR and albuminuria are important independent risk factors for kidney failure, acute kidney injury, and all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. These relationships are independent of age, sex, race, or ethnicity. eGFR and albuminuria can be combined with other demographic variables to accurately predict the risk of kidney failure and should be measured concurrently to determine diagnosis, staging, and prognosis in patients with CKD."
409,"Raising awareness, screening and prevention of chronic kidney disease: It takes more than a village.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem worldwide. Its prevalence and incidence are increasing, particularly among the ethnic minority populations. Diabetes, hypertension and obesity have been the three major aetiologies for CKD in all developed countries. While diabetes and hypertension remain the major causes of CKD in developing countries, environmental pollution, pesticides, water, analgesic abuse and herbal medications are common causes in these regions. Rapid urbanization and globalization are thought to be the contributing factors to rising prevalence and incidents of CKD. Despite the rising prevalence of CKD, disease awareness remains profoundly low. Worldwide, only 6% of the general population and 10% of the high-risk population are aware of their CKD statuses. Health screenings have been shown to be effective in improving the incidence of ESRD. However, currently there is no effective tool to assess and evaluate the awareness objectively."
410,Recent changes in vancomycin use in renal failure.,"Vancomycin is a key tool in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. A progressive increase in vancomycin resistance with consequent treatment failure has been observed in staphylococci. Therefore, new dosing guidelines advocating much higher vancomycin doses have been issued. Target trough levels of 15-20 microg/ml are proposed. Whether and how these targets can be achieved in patients with chronic kidney disease or those on dialysis are still under evaluation. The higher vancomycin doses to achieve these treatment targets carry a substantial risk for nephrotoxicity. This risk is incremental with higher trough levels and longer duration of vancomycin use. Critically ill patients, patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic agents, and patients with already compromised renal function are particularly at risk for vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity."
411,Measurement of insulin resistance in chronic kidney disease.,"Purpose of review: Insulin resistance is a known complication of end-stage renal disease that also appears to be present in earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and an important potential therapeutic target in this population. Measurement of insulin resistance is reviewed in the context of known pathophysiologic abnormalities in CKD. Recent findings: Insulin resistance in CKD is due to a high prevalence of known risk factors (e.g. obesity) and to unique metabolic abnormalities. The site of insulin resistance in CKD is localized to skeletal muscle. Estimates based on fasting insulin concentration may not adequately capture insulin resistance in CKD because they largely reflect hepatic defects and because CKD impairs insulin catabolism. A variety of dynamic tests are available to directly measure insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Summary: Insulin resistance may be an important therapeutic target in CKD. Complementary methods are available to assess insulin resistance, and each method has unique advantages, disadvantages, and levels of complexity. These characteristics, and the likelihood that CKD alters the performance of some insulin resistance measurements, must be considered when designing and interpreting clinical studies."
412,Disorders of hemostasis associated with chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health problem. CKD is typically associated with a prothrombotic tendency in the early stages of the disease, whereas in its more advanced stage, that is, end-stage renal disease, patients suffer from a prothrombotic tendency and, in many cases, a bleeding diathesis. The exact etiology behind the coexistence of these conflicting hemostatic disorders is poorly understood. This review critically appraises studies examining the abnormalities in the hemostasis pathway in patients with CKD, as well as the therapeutic options that are currently available to treat these individuals."
413,Balance of Benefit and Risk in Intravenous Iron Treatment in Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Iron supplementation is an important aspect of treatment for hemodialysis patients, with most administration by an intravenous route. As with any drug, decisions as to treatment are most meaningful when benefits and risks are weighed in the context of the individual patient's clinical characteristics. In this article, knowledge of benefits and risks of intravenous iron are reviewed."
414,"Significance, definition, classification and risk factors of chronic kidney disease in South Africa.","Renal dysfunction or chronic kidney disease (CKD) is found in 10% of the global population and is classified into five stages according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). No matter where a patient lives, estimation of the GFR is mandatory for decision-making and obtained by the simple measurement of a serum creatinine level. The objective of diagnosing CKD lies in its future prevention, early detection and proper treatment, which will prevent or delay functional deterioration. Primary hypertension (PH) occurs in 25% of South Africa (SA)s black population and is the putative cause of stage 5 CKD in 40 - 60% of these patients. Moreover, in this group, stage 5 CKD occurs at a relatively young age (35 - 45 years) compared with other population groups in whom stage 5 CKD resulting from PH usually occurs between 60 and 70 years of age. In the cohort study, PH has been found in 12 - 16% of black school learners (mean age 17 years) compared with 1.8 - 2% of other ethnic groups (mixed race, Asian, white). End-stage renal failure (ESRF) is the fifth most common cause of death in SA, excluding post-traumatic cases. In addition, undiagnosed or poorly controlled PH is a potent risk factor for other cardiovascular disease (CVD), e.g. congestive cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, stroke. Significant protein is also associated with CVD and protein >1 g/d is a significant risk factor for ESRF."
415,Renal function trajectory over time and adverse clinical outcomes.,"The growing burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with its associated morbidity and mortality, is recognized as a major public health problem globally and causing substantial load on health care systems. The current framework for the definition and staging of CKD, based on eGFR levels or presence of kidney damage, is useful for clinical classification of patients, but identifies a huge number of people as having CKD which is too many to target for intervention. The ability to identify a subset of patients, at high risk for adverse outcomes, would be useful to inform clinical management. The current staging system applies static definitions of kidney function that fail to capture the dynamic nature of the kidney disease over time. Now-a-days, it is possible to capture multiple measurements of different laboratory test results for an individual including eGFR values. A new possibility for identifying individuals at higher risk of adverse outcomes is being explored through assessment and consideration of the rate of change in kidney function over time, and this approach will be feasible in the current context of digitalization of health record keeping system. On the basis of the existing evidence, this paper summarizes important findings that support the concept of dynamic changes in kidney function over time, and discusses how the magnitude of these changes affect the future adverse outcomes of kidney disease, particularly the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), CVD and mortality."
416,Investigation of the Causes and Risk Factors of Previous End-Stage Renal Disease in Kidney Transplant Recipients.,"Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a pathophysiological process with many etiologic causes, often leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The distribution of the causes that lead to ESRD varies by country, race, and sex. Renal failure may be prevented by determining these differences and reducing the risk factors. Objective: The purpose of the study was to determine the causes and risk factors of previous ESRD in kidney transplant (KT) recipients. Methods: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, 393 KT recipients fitting the study criteria gave written consent to participate. Data were collected in face-to-face interviews at the Transplant Center using survey forms prepared by the researchers. Results: According to a multivariate logistic regression analysis of the dependent variable of ESRD diagnosis age of KT recipients, the factors affecting ESRD diagnosis age were found to be job (Odds ratio (OD) = 5.76; 95% CI [2.291-14.481]), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OD = 2.94; 95% CI [1.143-7.571]), polycystic kidney disease (PKD) (OD = 4.55; 95% CI [1.737-11.919]), hypertension (HT) (OD = 3.53; 95% CI [2.132-5.854]), family history of ESRD (OD = 0.57; 95% CI [0.341-0.963]), surgical procedure history (OD = 1.93; 95% CI [1.150-3.230]), and stress level (OD = 5.86, 95% CI [2.212-15.528]). Conclusion: It is important that we determine the changeable risk factors related to ESRD development in order to prepare strategies aimed at preventing ESRD, the frequency and prevalence of which is gradually increasing. Modifiable risk factors should be identified, particularly in KT recipients, to preserve the functions of the transplanted kidney."
417,Renal function in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract.,"Congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract are a major cause of chronic and end-stage renal failure in children. The molecular mechanisms having been elaborated, there is now growing evidence that kidney function is to a large extent determined genetically at an early stage. Assessment of kidney function is an important tool in clinical medicine and is feasible in utero. Postnatally, determination of absolute glomerular filtration rate and also of split and excretory renal function play an important role in the determination of treatment and prognosis. This is supplemented by other biochemical, molecular and interventional prognostic factors, which are of help in preservation of kidney survival by minimizing modulating factors. If chronic or terminal renal failure ensues in childhood or even in early infancy, however, improved medical care has led to encouraging results, ultimately influencing the motivation in the care of children with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract."
418,Renal insufficiency and failure.,"Renal impairment is a common complication of multiple myeloma. Chronic renal failure is classified according to glomerular filtration rate as estimated by the MDRD (modification of diet in renal disease) formula, while RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss and end-stage renal disease) and AKIN (acute renal injury network) criteria may be used for the definition of the severity of acute renal injury. Novel criteria based on estimated glomerular filtration rate measurements are proposed for the definition of the reversibility of renal impairment. Renal complete response (CRrenal) is defined as sustained (i.e., lasting at least 2 months) improvement of creatinine clearance (CRCL) from under 50 mL/min at baseline to 60 mL/min or above. Renal partial response (PRrenal) is defined as sustained improvement of CRCL from under 15 mL/min at baseline to 30 to 59 mL/min. Renal minor response (MRrenal) is defined as sustained improvement of the baseline CRCL of under 15 mL/min to 15 to 29 mL/min or, if baseline CRCL was 15 to 29 mL/min, improvement to 30 to 59 mL/min. Bortezomib with high-dose dexamethasone is considered the treatment of choice for myeloma patients with renal impairment and improves renal function in most patients. Although there is limited experience with thalidomide, this agent can be administered at the standard dosage to patients with renal failure. Lenalidomide, when administered at reduced doses according to renal function, is effective and can reverse renal impairment in a subset of myeloma patients."
419,Haematuria as a risk factor for chronic kidney disease progression in glomerular diseases: A review.,"Haematuria has long been considered to be a benign condition associated with glomerular diseases. However, new evidences suggest that haematuria has a pathogenic role in promoting kidney disease progression. An increased risk for end-stage renal disease has been reported in adolescents and young adults with persistent microscopic haematuria. A persistent impairment of renal function has been also reported following macroscopic haematuria-associated acute kidney injury in immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Haematuria-induced renal damage has been related to oxidant, cytotoxic and inflammatory effects induced by haemoglobin or haem released from red blood cells. The pathophysiological origin of haematuria may be due to a more fragile and easily ruptured glomerular filtration barrier, as reported in several glomerular diseases. In this review we describe a number of the key issues associated with the epidemiology and pathogenesis of haematuria-associated diseases, provide an update of recent knowledge on the role of haematuria on renal function outcome and discuss specific therapeutic approaches in this setting. KEY SUMMARY POINTS: 1. Glomerular haematuria is a common observation in a number of renal diseases that may lead to persistent renal injury. 2. Haematuria in children differs from that in adults in specific aspects, particularly in the frequency of glomerular diseases and renal disease outcome. 3. Regular follow-up of renal function in children with isolated microhaematuria may be recommended."
420,Diagnosis and management of chronic kidney disease.,"As the US population has continued to age, the number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has dramatically increased. Faced with this increase, clinicians need a better understanding of what an elevated serum creatinine level represents and a simple codified approach to evaluating renal failure. Creatinine, a muscle waste product, has an imperfect but predictable association with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Although other markers of GFR exist, including cystatin C, urea, inulin, and radioisotopic methods, their role in estimating GFR remains a matter for debate, especially that of cystatin C. Diagnosis and management of CKD are challenges for the nonspecialist. We describe a systematic approach that can be used by the nonspecialist to identify most but not all causes of renal insufficiency. Although this approach should allow for earlier recognition of treatable causes of CKD, it does not eliminate the involvement of a nephrologist in the care and management of the conditions causing the renal insufficiency. The nonspecialist should also be able to recognize the 9 therapies that are helpful in preservation of renal function in all patients with CKD."
421,Quality of Life of Patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease Receiving Conservative Care without Dialysis.,"With the evidence that dialysis may not necessarily be beneficial for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), there is a growing interest in promoting conservative care without dialysis as a viable treatment option for these individuals. This review summarizes the current empirical evidence of symptom experiences and quality of life of patients receiving conservative care. Data suggest that conservative care may yield symptom experiences and quality of life that are compatible with those of patients on dialysis. However, these data are exclusively from studies conducted outside of the United States in which there were often no comparison groups or study designs that could provide high quality evidence. There is an urgent need for further research and developing a conservative care model suitable for CKD populations in the U.S."
422,Chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease are risk factors for poor outcomes of Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the clinical outcomes of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods: A literature search was performed from inception through February 2015. Studies that reported relative risks, odds ratios or hazard ratios comparing the clinical outcomes of CDI in patients with CKD or ESRD and those without CKD or ESRD were included. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method. Results: Nineteen studies (a case-control and 18 cohort studies) with 116,875 patients assessing clinical outcomes of CDI were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled RR of severe or complicated CDI in CKD patients was 1.51 (95% CI: 1.00-2.28). The risk of recurrent CDI is significant higher in patients with a pooled RR of 2.73 (95% CI: 1.36-5.47). The pooled RR of mortality risk of CDI in patients with CKD, ESRD and CKD or ESRD were 1.76 (95% CI: 1.26-2.47), 1.58 (1.37-1.83) and 1.76 (1.32-2.34) respectively. Conclusion: This meta-analysis demonstrates poor outcomes of CDI including severe and recurrent CDI in CKD patients. History of CKD and ESRD are both associated with increased mortality risk in patients with CDI."
423,The rehabilitation role in chronic kidney and end stage renal disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide is rising markedly becoming a priority public health problem. The progression of CKD cause functional limitation and severe disability with poor quality of life. The aim of present review was to highlight the effect of rehabilitation in CKD and ESRD subjects. The rehabilitative process is unique in treating disabled people according to a holistic approach with the aim of supporting a person's independent living and autonomy. CKD are associated with an increased risk of functional impairment, independent of age, gender, and co-morbidities. Clinicians should counsel patients with CKD including frail elder people to increase physical activity levels and target that regular physical activity including aerobic or endurance exercises training benefits health. In old subjects with CKD and multiple functional impairments, the traditional disease based model should be changed to individualized patient-centered approach that prioritizes patient preferences. Patients receiving haemodialysis have a considerably lower exercise tolerance, functional capacity, and more muscle wasting than healthy subjects or patients with less severe CKD. Exercise training or comprehensive multi-dimensional strategy and goal-oriented intervention should be also provided in ESRD older subjects. Structured prevention programs based on reducing the risk factors for CKD and rehabilitative strategies could reduce disability occurrence."
424,Multidisciplinary strategies in the management of early chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide epidemic especially in developing countries, with clear deficiencies in identification and treatment. Better care of CKD requires more than only economic resources, utilization of health research in policy-making and health systems changes that produce better outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach may facilitate and improve management of patients from early CKD in the primary health-care setting. This approach is a strategy for improving comprehensive care, initiating and maintaining healthy behaviors, promoting teamwork, eliminating barriers to achieve goals and improving the processes of care. A multidisciplinary intervention may include educational processes guided by health professional, use of self-help groups and the development of a CKD management plan. The complex and fragmented care management of patients with CKD, associated with poor outcome, enhances the importance of implementing a multidisciplinary approach in the management of this disease from the early stages. Multidisciplinary strategies should focus on the needs of patients (to increase their empowerment) and should be adapted to the resources and health systems prevailing in each country; its systematic implementation can help to improve patient care and slow the progression of CKD."
425,Novel drugs and intervention strategies for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide health problem. The disease is most often progressive of nature with a high impact on patients and society. It is increasingly recognized that CKD can be detected in the early stages and should be managed as early as possible. Treatment of the cause, but in particular control of the main risk markers, such as high blood pressure, glucose and albuminuria, has been instrumental in delaying the progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, despite the state of the art therapy, the absolute risk of renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CKD patients remains devastatingly high. Novel drugs are therefore highly desirable to halt effectively the progressive renal (and cardiovascular) function loss. Recently, several novel strategies have been tested targeting traditional risk factors such as blood pressure (combination therapy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and novel mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) as well as dyslipidaemia (statins) with surprising results. In addition, drug targets specifically related to the kidney, such as vitamin D, uric acid, erythropoietin and phosphate, have been the subject of clinical trials, in some instances with unexpected results. Finally, novel targets including endothelin receptors and inflammatory pathways are increasingly explored as potential avenues to improve renal and cardiovascular protection, albeit that the drugs tested have not been unequivocally successful. In this article we review novel drugs or intervention strategies for the management of CKD, we try to provide explanations for the failure of some promising drugs and hypothesize on the potential success of new strategies."
426,The trend toward geriatric nephrology.,"Population aging has been accompanied by a growing burden of chronic medical conditions. Elderly individuals represent an increasing proportion of the total number of patients with chronic kidney disease, acute renal failure, and end-stage renal disease. In addition, age-related changes in the kidneys and other organ systems predispose the older person to disturbances in fluid and electrolyte balance, which exacerbate renal dysfunction. This article reviews the evolving epidemiology of renal disorders among the elderly and summarizes evidence put forward to explain this phenomenon."
427,Consequences of CKD on Functioning.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent in the United States and throughout the world,(1) with approximately 13% of adults affected.(2) In addition, according to recent estimates, almost half of patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 are 70 years of age and older.(2) In the United States, the number of prevalent end-stage renal disease cases continues to increase in patients older than age 65. In light of the demographic characteristics of patients with CKD and ESRD, there has been considerable focus on associations between CKD and cardiovascular outcomes.(3) Until recently, less attention had been paid to other consequences of CKD in general and among older individuals with CKD in particular, but there is now solid evidence linking CKD with impairments of physical function, cognitive function, and emotional function and quality of life. This review summarizes available literature on these topics, focusing specifically on physical functioning and frailty, cognitive function, emotional health, including depression and anxiety, and health-related quality of life."
428,Update on fibroblast growth factor 23 in chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health epidemic that affects millions of people worldwide. Presence of CKD predisposes individuals to high risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease, and premature death. Disordered phosphate homeostasis with elevated circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is an early and pervasive complication of CKD. CKD is likely the most common cause of chronically elevated FGF23 levels, and the clinical condition in which levels are most markedly elevated. Although increases in FGF23 levels help maintain serum phosphate in the normal range in CKD, prospective studies in populations of pre-dialysis CKD, incident and prevalent ESRD, and kidney transplant recipients demonstrate that elevated FGF23 levels are independently associated with progression of CKD and development of cardiovascular events and mortality. It was originally thought that these observations were driven by elevated FGF23 levels acting as a highly sensitive biomarker of toxicity due to phosphate. However, FGF23 itself has now been shown to mediate 'off-target,' direct, end-organ toxicity in the heart, which suggests that elevated FGF23 levels may be a novel mechanism of adverse outcomes in CKD. This report reviews recent advances in FGF23 biology relevant to CKD, the classical effects of FGF23 on mineral homeostasis, and the studies that established FGF23 excess as a biomarker and novel mechanism of cardiovascular disease. The report concludes with a critical review of the effects of different therapeutic strategies targeting FGF23 reduction and how these might be leveraged in a future randomized trial aimed at improving outcomes in CKD."
429,"Cognitive remediation in pediatric chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease: rationale, candidate interventions, and applicability.","The purpose of this paper is to address the potential use of cognitive remediation interventions for children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The prevalence and risk for neurocognitive dysfunction in children with this condition remains high, but, to date, interventions targeting these challenges have not been attempted either individually or as part of a larger treatment program. This is the next logical step in addressing the neurocognitive dysfunction that can be present in pediatric CKD/ESKD, with the field needing to determine the efficacy of cognitive remediation approaches for this population. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to raise this possibility by identifying candidate treatments addressing the neurocognitive challenges observed in children and adolescents with CKD/ESKD. Initially, we present the rationale for the importance of addressing the cognitive difficulties in this population, including an overview of the literature documenting the neurocognitive deficits associated with pediatric-onset CKD/ESKD. This is followed by a review of five candidate cognitive remediation programs that may be applicable to patients with this condition, and associated factors that could affect such treatment. The paper concludes with suggestions for both clinical and research initiatives that could be implemented to examine cognitive remediation as potential components of a larger treatment program for children and adolescents with CKD/ESKD."
430,Precision Medicine for Nutritional Management in End-Stage Kidney Disease and Transition to Dialysis.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health burden. Dialysis is not only costly but may not be readily available in developing countries. Even in highly developed nations, many patients may prefer to defer or avoid dialysis. Thus, alternative options to dialysis therapy or to complement dialysis are needed urgently and are important objectives in CKD management that could have huge clinical and economic implications globally. The role of nutritional therapy as a strategy to slow CKD progression and uremia was discussed as early as the late 19th and early 20th century, but was only seriously explored in the 1970s. There is a revival of interest recently owing to encouraging data as well as the increase of precision medicine with an emphasis on a personalized approach to CKD management. Although part of the explanation for the inconclusive data may relate to variations in study design and dietary prescription, diversity in genetic make-up, variations in the non-nutritional management of CKD, intra-individual variations in responses to dietary and nondietary treatment, psychosocial factors, and dietary compliance issues, these all may contribute to the heterogeneous data and responses. This brings in the evolving concept of precision medicine, in which disease management should be tailored and individualized according not only to clinical manifestations but also to the genetic make-up and biologic responses to therapy, which may vary depending on genetic composition. Precision nutrition management also should take into account patient demographics, social, psychological, education, and compliance factors, which all may influence the therapeutic needs and responses to the nutritional therapy prescribed. In this review, we provide a novel concept of precision medicine in nutritional management in end-stage kidney disease with a transition to dialysis and propose how this may be the way forward for nutritional therapy in the CKD population."
431,Cytomegalovirus seropositivity is independently associated with cardiovascular disease in non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease.,"Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of early death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Previous work has described an association between Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity and CVD amongst patients with dialysis dependent end stage renal disease. Whether CMV seropositivity is associated with CVD in non-dialysis dependent CKD has not been established. Aim: Investigate whether past CMV infection is associated with prevalent CVD in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD. Design: A retrospective observational study using the Renal Impairment in Secondary Care cohort, a study evaluating bio-clinical determinants of outcomes in patients with progressive CKD. Methods: We assayed cryopreserved serum samples collected at inception for anti-CMV IgG antibodies from 764 patients with stages 2 to 5 CKD (pre-dialysis) and investigated its relationship with prevalent CVD. Results: Median estimated glomerular filtration was 24 ml/min/1.73 m2 (IQR 19-32). Sixty-eight percent of patients were CMV seropositive. CMV seropositivity was associated with older age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, diabetes and higher social deprivation index score. On univariable analysis, CMV seropositivity correlated with higher systolic blood pressure (P = 0.044), prevalent CVD (P < 0.001), ischaemic heart disease (P < 0.001) and cerebrovascular disease (P = 0.022). On multivariable analysis, CMV seropositive patients nearly twice as likely to have CVD compared to seronegative patients [Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.998, CI 1.231-3.242, P = 0.005]. Conclusions: In patients with non-dialysis CKD, CMV seropositivity is independently associated with a higher prevalence of CVD."
432,Risk Prediction in CKD: The Rational Alignment of Health Care Resources in CKD 4/5 Care.,"CKD is a well-recognized global epidemic with consequences on patient morbidity, mortality, and health care resources. In the United States and Canada, a financial premium is often paid to programs and providers for caring for patients with Stage 4 to 5 CKD (not on dialysis) and is justified by the intensive care required by these patients, particularly in preparation for dialysis. About half of all patients with CKD Stages 3 and 4 never progress to kidney failure, and more than a quarter of them have stable kidney function for years. Among patients with Stage 3 CKD, even fewer progresses to kidney failure but small subpopulations with certain characteristics (eg, younger age, higher levels of proteinuria) have a more predictable trajectory. Clearly, a more robust method of screening patients for nephrology referral and subsequent enrollment into multidisciplinary clinics is needed to provide better efficiency within the health care system. The Kidney Failure Risk Equation is a generalizable CKD risk prediction model that has been externally validated and allows for the efficient risk-based triaging of nephrology referrals with a significant benefit to decreasing wait times. It is also efficiently used in a multidisciplinary kidney disease clinic with aiding timing in modality planning and frequency of follow-ups. The overall potential benefit of this system should allow for appropriate allocation of human resources to those at highest risk to yield optimal care in the most cost-effective manner to the health care system."
433,Periprocedural Concerns in the Patient with Renal Disease.,Treating patients with kidney disease can be both a difficult and a complex process. Understanding how to care for patients who have kidney disease is essential for lowering perioperative as well as periprocedural morbidity and mortality. The primary aim in renal evaluation and care is to control and mitigate factors that may result in acute kidney injury (AKI) and/or cause further decline in renal function. It is essential for the foot and ankle specialist to recognize patients who are predisposed to developing or already have impairment of renal function.
434,Renal disease in Cockayne syndrome.,"Background: Cockayne Syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive multi-systemic disorder, characterized; by developmental delay, microcephaly, severe growth failure and sensorial impairment. Renal complications have been reported but remain underinvestigated. The objective of this study was to perform a review of renal disease in a cohort of CS patients. Methods: We retrospectively collected relevant clinical, biochemical and genetic data from a cohort of 136 genetically confirmed CS patients. Blood pressure (BP), proteinuria, albuminemia, uric acid, creatinine clearance, renal ultrasounds and renal biopsy result were analysed. Results: Thirty-two patients had a renal investigation. We found that 69% of investigated patients had a renal disorder and/or an elevated BP. Fifteen out of 21 patients (71% of investigated patients) had an increased BP, 10 out of 16 patients (62% of investigated patients) presented with proteinuria and 4 of them had a nephrotic syndrome. Thirteen patients out of 29 (45%) had a decreased Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), 18 out of 25 patients (72%) had a hyperuricemia. No correlation with the genetic background or clinical types of CS was found, except for the renal clearance. Conclusions: Renal disease, increased blood pressure and hyperuricemia were highly prevalent in our study. We believe that CS patients should benefit from a nephrological follow-up and that anti-uric acid drug and Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor should be discussed in these patients."
435,Psoriasis and risk of incident chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Objectives: Patients with psoriasis may have a higher risk of developing chronic kidney (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) compared with general population. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively investigate this association by reviewing all available evidence. Methods: A systematic review was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE database from inception to January 2018 to identify all cohort studies that compared the risk of incident CKD and/or ESRD in patients with psoriasis versus individuals without psoriasis. Pooled risk ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated using random-effect, generic inverse variance method. Results: A total of four retrospective cohort studies with 199,808 patients with psoriasis were included. The risk of incident CKD and ESRD was significantly increased among patients with psoriasis with the pooled risk ratio of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.14-1.57) and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.05-1.60), respectively. Conclusion: A significantly increased risk of incident CKD and ESRD among patients with psoriasis compared with individuals without psoriasis was demonstrated in this study."
436,Mechanism by which chronic kidney disease causes cardiovascular disease and the measures to manage this phenomenon.,"In Japan, the number of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is thought to be 13,300,000, next in size after those with hypertension and diabetes. Although the number of patients with CKD seems large, it does not mean that all these patients require special treatment. Among them, nephrologists should pay special attention to patients with glomerular filtration rate below 50 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and progressive deterioration of renal function. Treatment of these CKD patients by a limited number of specialists is simply impossible; hence, it is essential to request treatment from physicians who are involved in general internal medicine and primary care. It is well known that not only does CKD cause end-stage renal failure, it also causes the onset of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as cardiac infarction and cerebral stroke; however, the question is how much significance does CKD have as a risk factor for CVD. It is understandable that hypertension and CVD are often complications of CKD; however, in addition to what is conventionally mentioned, there are three or four mechanisms that we would like to emphasize, and discuss herein. Among them, we would like to stress the role of klotho genes with special reference to the generation of CVD in CKD patients. When patients develop CKD, it is therefore necessary to remove as far as possible any factors that could represent a risk for CVD. Moreover, by taking appropriate measures against clinical conditions that often complicate CKD, such as hypertension, renal anemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidaemia, the development of CVD can be prevented."
437,The Fukuoka Kidney disease Registry (FKR) Study: design and methods.,"Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an established independent risk factor for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The onset and progression of CKD are associated with both genetic predisposition and various lifestyle-related factors, but little is known about the influence of genetic-environmental interactions on the incidence of ESRD or CVD in patients with CKD. Methods: The Fukuoka Kidney disease Registry (FKR) Study is designed as one of the largest prospective, multicenter, observational cohort studies in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients. The FKR Study aims to enroll approximately 5000 individuals at multiple clinical centers and follow them for up to at least 5 years. At baseline, subjects enrolled in the FKR Study will fill out extensive lifestyle-related questionnaires. Further, their health status and treatments will be monitored annually through a research network of nephrology centers. Blood and urine samples, including DNA/RNA, will be collected at the time of enrolment and every 5-years follow-up. Conclusions: The FKR Study will provide many insights into the onset and progression of CKD, which will suggest hypothesis-driven interventional clinical trials aimed at reducing the burden of CKD. The features of the FKR Study may also facilitate innovative research to identify and validate novel risk factors, including genetic susceptibility and biomarkers, using biomaterials by high-throughput omics technologies."
438,Common pathophysiological mechanisms of chronic kidney disease: therapeutic perspectives.,"It is estimated that over 10% of the adult population in developed countries have some degree of chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is a progressive and irreversible deterioration of the renal excretory function that results in implementation of renal replacement therapy in the form of dialysis or renal transplant, which may also lead to death. CKD poses a growing problem to society as the incidence of the disease increases at an annual rate of 8%, and consumes up to 2% of the global health expenditure. CKD is caused by a variety of factors including diabetes, hypertension, infection, reduced blood supply to the kidneys, obstruction of the urinary tract and genetic alterations. The nephropathies associated with some of these conditions have been modeled in animals, this being crucial to understanding their pathophysiological mechanism and assessing prospective treatments at the preclinical level. This article reviews and updates the pathophysiological knowledge acquired primarily from experimental models and human studies of CKD. It also highlights the common mechanism(s) underlying the most relevant chronic nephropathies which lead to the appearance of a progressive, common renal phenotype regardless of aetiology. Based on this knowledge, a therapeutic horizon for the treatment of CKD is described. Present therapy primarily based upon renin-angiotensin inhibition, future diagnostics and therapeutic perspectives based upon anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and hemodynamic approaches, new drugs targeting specific signaling pathways, and advances in gene and cell therapies, are all elaborated."
439,Personalized Anemia Management and Precision Medicine in ESA and Iron Pharmacology in End-Stage Kidney Disease.,"Substantial progress has been made in the application of computer-driven methods to provide erythropoietic dosing information for patients with anemia resulting from chronic kidney disease. Initial solutions were simply computerized versions of traditional paper-based anemia management protocols. True personalization was achieved through the use of advanced modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks, physiologic models, and feedback control systems. The superiority of any one technique over another has not been determined, but all methods have shown an advantage in at least one area over the traditional paper expert system used by most dialysis facilities. Improvements in the percentage of hemoglobin measurements within target range, decreased within-subject hemoglobin variability, decreased erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose, and decreased transfusion rates all have been shown."
440,A population-based cohort study defines prognoses in severe chronic kidney disease.,"In older people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and comorbidities, the risk of death or disability may overshadow the risk of kidney failure. To help refine this we did a retrospective population-based cohort study to evaluate the relative likelihood of adverse outcomes as functions of age and comorbidity burden among 47,228 adults with severe non-dialysis dependent CKD. We identified comorbidities using 29 validated algorithms applied to administrative data and assessed death, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and long-term care. Over five years of follow-up, 53.4% of participants died, 24.1% had a CVD event, 14.3% were placed into long-term care and 5.3% developed ESRD. Death was 145 times more likely and 11 times more likely than ESRD for participants aged 80 years or more and 60-79 years, respectively; long-term care was 30 times more likely and 1.7 times as likely as ESRD for participants aged 80 years or more and 60-79 years, respectively. Increasing comorbidity burden was similarly associated with increased risk of death and long-term care placement but reduced the likelihood of ESRD, and the risks of increasing age were similarly incremental. Thus, among patients with severe CKD, older age and/or higher comorbidity burden, death and long-term care placement are markedly more likely than ESRD. Hence, clinicians, patients and families should all consider the relative magnitude of these risks when making decisions about renal replacement."
441,Prognostic models for chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and external validation.,"Background: Accurate risk prediction is needed in order to provide personalized healthcare for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. An overload of prognosis studies is being published, ranging from individual biomarker studies to full prediction studies. We aim to systematically appraise published prognosis studies investigating multiple biomarkers and their role in risk predictions. Our primary objective was to investigate if the prognostic models that are reported in the literature were of sufficient quality and to externally validate them. Methods: We undertook a systematic review and appraised the quality of studies reporting multivariable prognosis models for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality in CKD patients. We subsequently externally validated these models in a randomized trial that included patients from a broad CKD population. Results: We identified 91 papers describing 36 multivariable models for prognosis of ESRD, 50 for CV events, 46 for mortality and 17 for a composite outcome. Most studies were deemed of moderate quality. Moreover, they often adopted different definitions for the primary outcome and rarely reported full model equations (21% of the included studies). External validation was performed in the Multifactorial Approach and Superior Treatment Efficacy in Renal Patients with the Aid of Nurse Practitioners trial (n = 788, with 160 events for ESRD, 79 for CV and 102 for mortality). The 24 models that reported full model equations showed a great variability in their performance, although calibration remained fairly adequate for most models, except when predicting mortality (calibration slope >1.5). Conclusions: This review shows that there is an abundance of multivariable prognosis models for the CKD population. Most studies were considered of moderate quality, and they were reported and analysed in such a manner that their results cannot directly be used in follow-up research or in clinical practice."
442,Hypertension in pregnancy: A future risk for chronic kidney disease in South Africa.,"Background: Hypertension in pregnancy is a risk factor for end-stage chronic kidney disease (ESKD) and is particularly common in South Africa (SA). There are no data for the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Objectives: To conduct a study of all female patients who presented to the renal replacement programme at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, SA. Methods: This was a retrospective study of female patients with ESKD who were presented to renal replacement meetings between 2007 and 2017. For each patient who was assessed, there was a comprehensive letter detailing patient demographics, as well as psychosocial and medical history, which served as the source data. Patients with a history of hypertension in pregnancy were identified as the case group and those without the condition were the control group. Patient demographics, causes of CKD, kidney function and outcome of the meeting were documented. Results: Of the 415 female patients with ESKD, 70 (16.9%) had a history of hypertension in pregnancy. The ethnic breakdown was as follows: 132 (42.44%) black, 172 (55.3%) mixed ancestry and 7 (2.25%) white. Compared with the control group, the patients were younger, with a median age of 33 v. 41 years (p&lt;0.001), higher serum creatinine 1 045 v. 751 μmol/L (p=0.017) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 4.0 v. 5.1 mL/min (p=0.029). Patients were more likely to abuse methamphetamine (5.7 v. 1.7%; p=0.049), and less likely to be diabetic (1.4 v. 20.9%; p&lt;0.001) or HIV-positive (2.9 v. 12.5%; p=0.019). There were no ethnic differences between patients and controls. Underlying causes of renal disease showed significant differences, as patients were more likely to have hypertensive nephropathy (57.1 v. 22.9%; p&lt;0.0001), and less likely to have diabetic kidney disease (1.4 v. 20.4%; p&lt;0.001), HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) (1.4 v. 6.4%) or polycystic kidney disease (1.4 v. 7.0%). There was no difference in acceptance to the dialysis and transplant programme (53 v. 47%). Conclusions: This study suggests an important link between hypertension in pregnancy and ESKD. The patients were significantly younger, presented later and were more likely to have hypertensive nephropathy. Methamphetamine abuse appears to be a risk factor. The study suggests that all women with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy need further evaluation and follow-up postpartum."
443,Safety of medical therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.,"Purpose of review: Maintaining patient safety is a necessary step to improve healthcare delivery. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have an increased frequency of adverse safety events largely because of medication errors. Recent findings: CKD and ESRD have several features which threaten patient safety. Reduced glomerular filtration rate affects the clearance of many medications and is also associated with several comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and anemia. These comorbidities of CKD often increase the complexity of treatment regimens. Patients with ESRD, requiring dialysis or transplantation, have an even greater potential for adverse safety events because of the reliance on renal replacement modalities and the frequent requirements of polypharmacy and potential drug-drug interactions. Summary: There is an important need to develop strategies to provide inpatient and outpatient management plans to limit the risk of adverse medication errors across a wide range of educational and socioeconomic backgrounds, and a critical need to develop a uniform set of standards for evaluating patient safety in CKD and ESRD as well as appropriate descriptions of the prototypical safety profiles of patients who have CKD, a kidney transplant, or who are on dialysis."
444,[Diseases of solitary kidney: the history and evolution of scientific issues].,"The lecture is devoted to one of the most important problems of modern urology, which has a long scientific history--the diseases of solitary kidney after nephrectomy. Fundamental theory of solitary kidney was laid in the early XX century, during which it was significantly enriched by fundamental provisions preserving their practical significance in the present time. In the domestic literature of the last decade, however, the problem of diseases of solitary kidney is undeservedly forgotten and slightly developed. At the same time, recent data suggest a certain theoretical and practical conflict in this section of urology: on the one hand, the incidence of diseases of solitary kidney in the last 50 years has increased by at least a 2 times; on the other--an effective conservative treatments of diseases of solitary kidney at different stages of kidney failure have not yet implemented in clinical practice, except hemodialysis and renal transplantation used in the terminal stages of chronic renal failure. Methods of primary and secondary prevention of diseases of solitary kidney are not developed at all. The history and evolution of problems of diseases of solitary kidney is a good example of fact that despite available data and accumulation of new scientific evidence of the close relationship between local and systemic factors in the pathogenesis of these diseases, their new rethinking in the framework of interdisciplinary interactions for the optimization of methods of clinical management of this specific group of patients as well as for the development of new effective methods for early diagnosis, treatment and prevention are required."
445,The influence of multiple episodes of acute kidney injury on survival and progression to end stage kidney disease in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common syndromes associated with significant morbidity, mortality and cost. The extent to which repeated AKI episodes may cumulatively affect the rate of progression of all-cause CKD has not previously been investigated. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that repeated episodes of AKI increase the rate of renal functional deterioration loss in patients recruited to a large, all-cause CKD cohort. Methods: Patients from the Salford Kidney Study (SKS) were considered. Application of KDIGO criteria to all available laboratory measurements of renal function identified episodes of AKI. A competing risks model was specified for four survival events: Stage 1 AKI; stage 2 or 3 AKI; dialysis initiation or transplant before AKI event; death before AKI event. The model was adjusted for patient age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, diabetic status, cardiovascular co-morbidities, and primary renal disease. Analyses were performed for patients' first, second, and third or more AKI episodes. Results: A total of 48,338 creatinine measurements were available for 2287 patients (median 13 measures per patient [IQR 6-26]). There was a median age of 66.8years, median eGFR of 28.4 and 31.6% had type 1 or 2 diabetes. Six hundred and forty three (28.1%) patients suffered one or more AKI events; 1000 AKI events (58% AKI 1) in total were observed over a median follow-up of 2.6 years [IQR 1.1-3.2]. In patients who suffered an AKI, a second AKI was more likely to be a stage 2 or 3 AKI than stage 1 [HR 2.04, p 0.01]. AKI events were associated with progression to RRT, with multiple episodes of AKI progressively increasing likelihood of progression to RRT [HR 14.4 after 1 episode of AKI, HR 28.4 after 2 episodes of AKI]. However, suffering one or more AKI events was not associated with an increased risk of mortality. Conclusions: AKI events are associated with more rapid CKD deterioration as hypothesised, and also with a greater severity of subsequent AKI. However, our study did not find an association of AKI with increased mortality risk in this CKD cohort."
446,Residual renal function: a paradigm shift.,"Residual renal function (RRF) in patients undergoing dialysis treatments is currently viewed as glomerular filtrate that has escaped tubular reabsorption. RRF has been quantified as a clearance of urea or creatinine, or urea + creatinine. A major paradigm shift has followed the recognition that a substantial number of organic anion retention solutes (possible ""uremic toxins"") are protein-bound and therefore are not readily filtered. These protein-bound aryl compounds are secreted by renal tubular organic anion transporters (OATs). This has led to the recognition that RRF in dialysis patients probably represents not only unreabsorbed glomerular filtrate but also a contribution of renal tubular transporters that secrete organic anions. Tubular secretion of hippurate, indoxyl sulfate, and p-cresol sulfate, protein-bound organic anions retained in the plasma of end-stage renal disease patients, can be quantified and used to evaluate the integrity of a function dependent on active solute transport. Here we propose a shift away from the exclusive ""glomerulocentric"" view of RRF as unreabsorbed glomerular filtrate and of the progression of renal disease as progressive glomerular loss. We expand the definition of RRF to include the combined renal and tubule functions remaining after a disease begins to destroy nephrons and proceeds to anuria. We propose renewed application of the first principles of renal physiology, articulated in the last century by Homer Smith, to the understanding and monitoring of RRF and progression of renal injury in patients during the sometimes long course of and at the end stage of chronic renal disease."
447,Kidney-Related Research in the United States: A Position Statement From the National Kidney Foundation and the American Society of Nephrology.,"Kidney disease is an important US public health problem because it affects over 37 million Americans, and Medicare expenditures for patients with chronic kidney disease now alone exceed $130 billion annually. Kidney disease is characterized by strong racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities, and reducing kidney disease incidence will positively impact US health disparities. Due to the aging of the US population and an unabated obesity epidemic, the number of patients receiving treatment for kidney failure is anticipated to increase, which will escalate kidney disease health expenditures. The historical and current investment in kidney-related research via the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has severely lagged behind ongoing expenditures for kidney disease care. Increasing research investment will identify, develop, and increase implementation of interventions to slow kidney disease progression, reduce incidence of kidney failure, enhance survival, and improve quality of life. This perspective states the urgent reasons why increasing investment in kidney-related research is important for US public health. The National Kidney Foundation and the American Society of Nephrology are working together to advocate for increased funding for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The long-term goal is to reduce the burden of kidney disease in the US population and improve the quality of life of patients living with kidney disease."
448,Cardiovascular autonomic nervous system dysfunction in chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease: disruption of the complementary forces.,"Purpose of review: Several nontraditional risk factors have been the focus of research in an attempt to understand the disproportionately high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) populations. One such category of risk factors is cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. Its true prevalence in the CKD/ESKD population is unknown but existing evidence suggests it is common. Due to lack of standardized diagnostic and treatment options, this condition remains undiagnosed and untreated in many patients. In this review, we discuss current evidence pointing toward the role of autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in CKD, building off of crucial historical evidence and thereby highlighting the areas in need for future research interest. Recent findings: There are several key mediators and pathways leading to cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in CKD and ESKD. We review studies exploring the mechanisms involved and discuss the current measurement tools and indices to evaluate the ANS and their pitfalls. There is a strong line of evidence establishing the temporal sequence of worsening autonomic function and kidney function and vice versa. Evidence linking ANS dysfunction and arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, intradialytic hypotension, heart failure and hypertension are discussed. Summary: There is a need for early recognition and referral of CKD and ESKD patients suspected of cardiovascular ANS dysfunction to prevent the downstream effects described in this review.There are many unknowns in this area and a clear need for further research."

450,Stroke and renal dysfunction.,"Stroke is the most frequent neurological disease and represents a continuously evolving medical and social problem. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also an important worldwide public health problem. Renal dysfunction carries a substantial risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and an independent, graded association between renal function and cardiovascular events was found. In the last 15years the link between CKD and cerebrovascular disease has become more apparent. Patients with end stage renal disease treated with maintenance hemodialysis have a much higher incidence of stroke than the general population and stroke is one of the major causes of death in these patients. Nowadays ischemic subtype of stroke is present in approximately 70% of dialysis patients. In population based studies conflicting results have been reported about the association between stroke and CKD before replacement therapy. However, in high risk patients, defined by the presence of either cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors, different stages of CKD are clearly associated with subsequent stroke. In patients with stroke the exact prevalence of renal dysfunction is not known. Reported prevalence from a few published studies is up to 38% and it is higher than that in age-matched control groups. Furthermore, in patients suffering from stroke renal dysfunction is associated with short and long term mortality. The most effective treatment of stroke in patients with CKD is not known and further studies are needed."
451,Pregnancy in Chronic Kidney Disease: questions and answers in a changing panorama.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly encountered in pregnancy because of greater diagnostic awareness, which is a reflection of the newer, broader definitions (i.e., any changes in blood or urine composition or at imaging, or a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of <60 mL/min lasting at least 3 months) and of increased incidence (higher maternal age and better outcomes of several kidney diseases). CKD is extremely heterogeneous and may be described by the degree of GFR reduction (CKD stages), the presence of proteinuria and hypertension and the type of kidney disease; the risk of adverse pregnancy-related events increases as GFR decreases and it is affected by proteinuria and hypertension. Specific risks are reported in various diseases such as lupus nephropathy or diabetic nephropathy. While transplantation at least partially restores fertility in end-stage kidney disease, pregnancy on dialysis is increasingly reported. This chapter deals with the available evidence on the management of CKD patients in pregnancy."
452,Advanced glycation end products in renal failure: an overview.,"The article aims to present an overview of the existing knowledge on advanced glycation end products (AGE). They are moieties that bind to proteins, but also lipids and nuclear acids. AGE are formed during glycation and oxidative stress. Accumulation of AGE occurs especially in diabetes and chronic renal failure and plays a major pathogenetic role. The deleterious effects of AGE result from cross-linking of proteins and activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products. AGE accumulation can be noninvasively assessed by the skin autofluorescence reader. In diabetics, the skin autofluorescence predicts cardiac mortality and the occurrence of macro- and microvascular complications. In patients on haemodialysis, skin autofluorescence is highly elevated and predicts mortality. After renal transplantation AGE accumulation is lower than during haemodialysis, but still remains elevated and is a strong risk factor for chronic renal transplant dysfunction. Some of the potential methods to intervene with AGE accumulation are discussed in this article."
453,Fibroblast growth factor 23: associations with cardiovascular disease and mortality in chronic kidney disease.,"Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) has emerged as an important hormone involved in phosphorus and vitamin D homeostasis. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the most common clinical condition in which FGF-23 levels are persistently and markedly elevated. Abnormal phosphate homeostasis and high circulating levels of FGF-23 are early complications of CKD. Although increases in FGF-23 levels may help maintain serum phosphate levels in the normal range in CKD, the long-term effects of its sustained elevated levels are unclear. Patients with CKD have high risks of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease, and premature death. Recent prospective studies in populations with predialysis CKD, ESRD on hemodialysis, and kidney transplant recipients demonstrate that elevated FGF-23 levels are independently associated with cardiovascular events and mortality. It was originally thought that FGF-23 was only a biomarker of disturbed phosphate balance; however, recent studies have shown that FGF-23 can have a direct effect on the heart, inducing left ventricular hypertrophy. This suggests that elevated FGF-23 levels may be a novel mechanism that explains the poor cardiovascular outcomes in CKD patients. Interventional studies are required in order to clarify the relation of causality between FGF-23 and cardiovascular mortality in this population."
454,Education for patients with progressive CKD and acute-start dialysis.,"For individuals living with CKD and those who have been discovered to have ESRD, the decisions facing them can be daunting. Such decisions include having renal replacement therapy (RRT) or conservative care, having a kidney transplant, or selecting a modality of dialysis that would fit their lifestyle and values. Education at this critical time is essential, but it must be tailored to the individual and his or her readiness to learn, and it must be provided with empathy and understanding of the chronicity of the disease and the magnitude of the effect of kidney failure on their life. We present strategies derived from education and psychology that can assist health-care practitioners to provide such education and support to individuals with advanced CKD. We also present an approach to educate and support those who have urgently started dialysis and require chronic RRT. This educational model has its basis in theories of education and decision-making and has been used with success in this population."
455,[Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease].,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is set in 5 stages of increasing severity with a decrease in glomerular filtration rate leading to end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring a treatment of substitution, dialysis or transplantation. CKD is frequent, it increases with age, and affects one person out of 10 in the general population, and only 4 per 100,000 will reach end-stage renal disease (ESRD). As soon as it occurs, CKD is associated with increased cardiovascular comorbid conditions. Mortality in dialysis is far higher than in the general population. In France, more than 4 billion Euros per year, i.e. 2% of the overall health expenditures, are dedicated to the treatment of 0.11% of the population. It is, therefore at the early stages of CKD that the efforts of screening and prevention of ESRD should be targeted."
456,Etiological profile of chronic kidney disease: A single-center retrospective hospital-based study.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the leading causes of chronic diseases globally, with rising incidence and prevalence. It is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and coronary artery disease, which are the main causes of death in this population. The etiology of CKD is varied. This study was performed to evaluate the various etiologies of CKD among patients presenting to the Department of Nephrology, Guwahati Medical College, a tertiary referral center. A total of 5718 CKD patients were evaluated to identify the cause of CKD. The most common cause was found to be diabetes mellitus in 42.2%, followed by chronic glomerulonephritis in 21.4%, hypertension in 19.5%, obstructive uropathy in 6.9%, chronic interstitial nephritis in 3.6%, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in 1.5% of the patients. Nearly 2.7% of the patients had CKD of unknown etiology. Most of the common causes of CKD are potentially treatable and initiating appropriate treatment early may prevent the development of CKD or progression to end-stage renal disease."
457,[Pharmacokinetic changes in renal failure].,"DRUG PHARMACOKINETICS: One of the first steps in the clinical development of drugs consists in studies of their pharmacokinetics. Dosage and administration interval necessary to ensure secure and efficient plasma levels are derived from the values of pharmacokinetic parameters. Renal disease usually implies multiple pathophysiological modifications that generate alteration in drugs pharmacokinetic profile. Those modifications mainly occur on elimination phase but also to a significant extent on absorption and distribution. PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES: In this article we describe potential alteration in drugs absorption, distribution (volume of distribution, binding to plasma proteins), hepatic or renal metabolism, and parent compound and/or metabolites elimination in patients with renal insufficiency. Furthermore, in patients with end-stage renal disease treated by dialysis, drugs are likely to be removed by extracorporal epuration and dosage and/or interval modifications should thus be applied to treatments in those patients. Clinical assessment: Pharmacokinetics of drugs should be evaluated in patients with renal failure to determine whereas dosage and/or administration interval should thus be modified to enhance tolerance and pharmacological efficacy. Such studies are obviously necessary for drugs that are mainly excreted unchanged in urine. They should also be performed for drugs that are mainly degraded in the liver with emphasis on metabolites pharmacokinetics."
458,Epidemiology of vascular disease in renal failure.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the general population and a major cause of morbidity and mortality chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. The high prevalence of CVD in incident dialysis populations suggests that CVD begins during or before the stage of chronic renal insufficiency. While traditional risk factors observed in the general population may play a role in the progression of CVD in CKD and ESRD patients, the presence of several nontraditional factors related to the extent of uremia seems to be the more significant feature of CVD in this patient population. Recently, there have been significant advances in our understanding of how inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. The fact that chronic inflammation and CVD are highly prevalent in ESRD patients, it is probable that chronic inflammation may be a causative factor for accelerated atherosclerosis observed in CKD and ESRD patients. Given the extent of the problem, efforts to lower the mortality rate among ESRD patients will require new approaches to reduce and/or prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
459,A critique of the UK NICE guidance for the detection and management of individuals with chronic kidney disease.,"The increasing global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has significant public health and economic implications. The recently published UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines for the early identification and management of CKD provide a framework of disease management for both primary and secondary care with the stated aim of reducing the progression of CKD and the associated risk of cardiovascular death. Identification of at-risk individuals with proteinuria and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system are the cornerstones of this strategy. However, the vast majority of patients with CKD will not develop ESRD and it is far from clear whether the NICE recommendations will reduce either ESRD or cardiovascular death associated with CKD."
460,Clinical pharmacy activities in chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease patients: a systematic literature review.,"Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) represent worldwide health problems with an epidemic extent. Therefore, attention must be given to the optimisation of patient care, as gaps in the care of CKD and ESRD patients are well documented. As part of a multidisciplinary patient care strategy, clinical pharmacy services have led to improvements in patient care. The purpose of this study was to summarise the available evidence regarding the role and impact of clinical pharmacy services for these patient populations. Methods: A literature search was conducted using the Medline, Embase and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases to identify relevant studies on the impact of clinical pharmacists on CKD and ESRD patients, regarding disease-oriented and patient-oriented outcomes, and clinical pharmacist interventions on drug-related problems. Results: Among a total of 21 studies, only four (19%) were controlled trials. The majority of studies were descriptive (67%) and before-after studies (14%). Interventions comprised general clinical pharmacy services with a focus on detecting, resolving and preventing drug-related problems, clinical pharmacy services with a focus on disease management, or clinical pharmacy services with a focus on patient education in order to increase medication knowledge. Anaemia was the most common comorbidity managed by clinical pharmacists, and their involvement led to significant improvement in investigated disease-oriented outcomes, for example, haemoglobin levels. Only four of the studies (including three controlled trials) presented data on patient-oriented outcomes, for example, quality of life and length of hospitalisation. Studies investigating the number and type of clinical pharmacist interventions and physician acceptance rates reported a mean acceptance rate of 79%. The most common reported drug-related problems were incorrect dosing, the need for additional pharmacotherapy, and medical record discrepancies. Conclusions: Few high-quality trials addressing the benefit and impact of clinical pharmacy services in CKD and ESRD patients have been published. However, all available studies reported some positive impact resulting from clinical pharmacist involvement, including various investigated outcome measures that could be improved. Additional randomised controlled trials investigating patient-oriented outcomes are needed to further determine the role of clinical pharmacists and the benefits of clinical pharmacy services to CKD and ESRD patients."
461,Targeting the renin angiotensin system in dialysis patients.,"Patients on chronic dialysis therapy have a dramatic excess cardiovascular risk compared to any other population, including those with overt diabetic nephropathy. Despite this, patients on dialysis are almost invariably excluded from trials evaluating the cardioprotective effect of novel treatments. Consistent evidence is available that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), are more cardioprotective than other antihypertensive agents in patients with chronic renal disease or diabetes (with or without renal involvement), but whether this applies also to patients on dialysis is unknown. However, clear evidence is available that ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce morbidity and mortality in patients on dialysis with heart failure (HF) or atrial fibrillation (AF). Moreover, these drugs may preserve residual renal function in those with preterminal kidney failure as well as vascular access and peritoneal membrane function in those on extracorporeal or peritoneal dialysis, respectively. These drugs also show an excellent tolerability profile in this population. Thus, ACE inhibitors and ARBs are indicated in patients on dialysis with HF or AF. Available evidence suggests that they should be first-choice therapy in patients on dialysis with hypertension, though trials are still needed to formally demonstrate their superior cardioprotective effect over other antihypertensives in this population."
462,Long-Term Mortality among Hospitalized Non-ICU Patients with Acute Kidney Injury Referred to Nephrology.,"Background: Epidemiological studies of acute kidney injury (AKI) have focused on patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), and several have studied hospitalized non-ICU patients, but analysis of patients referred to Nephrology is sparse. We analyzed factors associated with short- and long-term morbimortality among hospitalized non-ICU patients with AKI who were referred to Nephrology. Methods: A retrospective study with data prospectively collected from 170 non-ICU patients, with referral to the Nephrology Unit, recruited over a 4-year period, was performed. AKI was classified according to the criteria based on risk, injury, failure, loss of kidney function and end-stage kidney disease (RIFLE). Risk factors that could influence prognosis of AKI and long-term mortality were analyzed at admission. Early on, 1- and 10-year mortalities were correlated with AKI RIFLE class, clinical and demographic characteristics. Results: Most patients were >65 years, with multiple comorbidities and frequent drug intake history. Median Charlson score was 6. Twenty-five percent of patients with previously unknown chronic kidney disease (CKD) were diagnosed with CKD during the study. Dialysis was required in 13.5% of patients. Hospital deaths were 22.4% and significantly associated with older age, RIFLE class L, higher peak serum creatinine, oliguria and decreased serum albumin levels. One-year (38.8%) and 10-year (68.8%) mortalities were significantly associated with age, prior cardiovascular disease, prior CKD and RIFLE class L. According to the Cox proportional hazard model, age, prior CKD and RIFLE class L were independent risk factors of death at 1 and 10 years. Conclusions: AKI in hospitalized non-ICU patients is associated with high early and late mortality. This study increases our understanding of AKI among this specific population and can improve their management."
463,Smoking--a renal risk factor.,"One of the most important tasks of clinical and experimental nephrology is to identify the risk factors of progression of renal failure. A major renal risk factor which has not been sufficiently acknowledged despite increasing evidence is cigarette smoking. Diabetologists were the first to recognize the adverse effects of smoking on the kidney: both in type 1 and in type 2 diabetes smoking (i) increases the risk of development of nephropathy and (ii) nearly doubles the rate of progression to end-stage renal failure. Until recently it was not known whether smoking also increases the risk to progress to end-stage renal failure in patients with primary renal disease. A retrospective multicenter European case-control study showed that smoking is an independent risk factor for end-stage renal failure in patients with inflammatory and noninflammatory renal disease, i.e. IgA glomerulonephritis and polycystic kidney disease. The pathogenesis of the smoking-related renal damage is largely unknown. The intermittent increase in blood pressure during smoking seems to play a major role in causing renal damage, but further potential pathomechanisms are presumably also operative. Smoking as a renal risk factor is of great interest to diabetologists as well as nephrologists, but unfortunately so far this information has had little impact on patient management. The present article reviews the current knowledge about the renal risks of smoking and discusses the potential mechanisms of smoking-mediated renal injury."
464,Biomarkers in native and transplant kidneys: opportunities to improve prediction of outcomes in chronic kidney disease.,"Purpose of review: Predicting the outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is important from both patient and healthcare system perspectives. This review examines the current state of conventional and nonconventional biomarkers as noninvasive tools to improve risk-stratification and outcome prediction in CKD. Recent findings: Conventional biomarkers (serum creatinine, urine albumin, and clinical variables such as sex, age, and diabetes) have been the cornerstone of most prediction models for CKD progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and adverse cardiovascular outcomes including death. With better understanding of the pathophysiology of CKD and the evolution of molecular diagnostics, numerous novel or nonconventional markers have emerged. They have been examined individually and in combination to predict specific outcomes. We highlight these markers and studies, conducted primarily in patients with native kidneys. In those with transplant kidneys, markers of both acute and chronic kidney dysfunction have been examined, although to a lesser extent. Similarities and differences in knowledge derived from these two populations are highlighted. Summary: Improving prediction of outcomes in CKD patients with either native or transplant kidneys remains an important goal. Increasingly sophisticated biomarkers may potentially identify targets for clinical research, improve the nature and timing of therapeutic interventions, and guide resource allocation."
465,Africa and nephrology: the forgotten continent.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not a priority on the health agenda in Africa and it remains a 'forgotten condition'. Most people in Africa do not have access to dialysis or transplantation, if they develop end-stage renal disease. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and HIV/AIDS enjoy a more prominent profile as a serious cause of morbidity and mortality, but despite the clear links of CVD and HIV with CKD, there has been a failure to highlight the link between chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension and HIV/AIDS and both CKD and CVD. Management of chronic illnesses requires a functioning public health system and good links between primary and specialist care. Despite calls to establish CKD prevention programs, there are very few in Africa and they have not been integrated into existing primary healthcare systems. This is aggravated by shortages of both financial and human resources and failure to strengthen health systems managing chronic diseases. The result is that very few people in Africa with CKD are managed early or receive dialysis or transplantation. This article investigates some of the issues impacting on the recognition of CKD as a public health issue, and will also consider some factors which could make CKD a more prominent chronic disease in Africa."
466,Prognostic impact of galectin-3 in chronic kidney disease patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: Galectin-3 as a β-galactoside-binding lectin, which has served important functions in numerous biological activities including cell growth, apoptosis, pre-mRNA splicing, differentiation, transformation, angiogenesis, inflammation, fibrosis, and host defense, may be used in prediction of clinical outcomes in CKD patients. However, the given results remain debatable and inconclusive. Hence, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to clarify the predictive value of galectin-3 in patients with CKD, especially ESRD patients going on dialysis. Methods: PubMed and Embase electronic databases were searched to identify eligible studies reporting the association between galectin-3 and adverse outcomes in CKD patients. We searched the literatures published October 2018 or earlier. We used both fix-effects and random-effects models to calculate the overall effect estimate. An I2 > 50% indicates at least moderate statistical heterogeneity. A sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were performed to find the origin of heterogeneity. Results: We ultimately enrolled five studies with a total of 5226 patients in this meta-analysis. The result showed that high galectin-3 levels were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) events in CKD patients. For every 1% increased in galectin-3, the risk of all-cause mortality increased by 37.9% (HR 1.379, 95% CI 1.090-1.744). Much more, the risk of CV events in CKD patients was also significantly increased (HR 1.054, 95% CI 1.007-1.102) with no statistical heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.623). However, there was no statistical difference between the risk of all-cause mortality and galectin-3 in HD patients (HR 1.171, 95% CI 0.963-1.425). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that high levels of galectin-3 may increase the risk of all-cause mortality and CV events in CKD patients, however, probably not a sensitive biomarker for outcomes in HD patients. Further studies were warranted to validate our findings."
467,Which diet for which renal failure: making sense of the options.,"This review describes categories of renal function (normal, renal insufficiency, end-stage renal failure), types of treatment modalities (renal insufficiency management, dialysis, transplantation), and corresponding dietary parameters (protein, energy, fiber, sodium, fluid, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, vitamins, minerals). The focus is directed toward general and nonrenal specialty practitioners, who are encountering a growing number of geriatric patients and patients who have undergone renal transplantation or are in early renal failure. The findings indicate that early intervention may delay or prevent rapid progression of renal disease in some patients, that treatment modalities continue to need individualized dietary support to maintain nutritional status, and that transplant goals should include control of obesity and hyperlipidemia to reduce cardiovascular mortality."
468,"Compliance, adherence, and self-management: is a paradigm shift possible for chronic kidney disease clients?","Exploring the concepts of compliance, adherence, and self-management in people living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is imperative. The literature indicates that compliance and adherence behaviours are poorly understood within the renal client population. Preliminary research on self-management suggests that when practitioners include the patients' beliefs, values, and concerns into the recommended treatment regimen, CKD client outcomes improved. Nursing professionals need to shift their practice to incorporate self-management strategies. Examining the theoretical foundation of self-management as well as qualitative and quantitative research findings will provide nurses with innovative directions to enhance client care and suggest future research on individuals diagnosed with CKD."
469,Assessment of cognitive dysfunction in kidney disease.,"Cognitive dysfunction includes reduced mental alertness, intellectual impairment, decreased attention and concentration, memory deficits and diminished perceptual-motor coordination. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients may suffer from cognitive impairment, which may decrease an individual's quality of life, increase resource utilization and result in suboptimal medical care. This study was carried out on 120 patients with different stages of CKD from our nephrology outpatient clinic divided into three groups: Group I: 50 CKD patients, stage 3 and stage 4; Group II: 50 end-stage renal disease patients on regular hemodialysis with K t/v >1.1; and Group III: 20 acute kidney injury patients, followed-up till their renal functions stabilized besides Group IV: 20 healthy subjects served as controls. All patients underwent laboratory investigations and psychometric tests, which include trial making test part B, digit span test, digit symbol test and mini-mental state examination. There was a significant difference of mean values of cognitive function tests in Groups I, II and III on comparing them with Group IV. Stage 3 CKD scored better than stage 4 CKD, which was worse than hemodialysis patients, and lastly acute kidney injury patients had mild cognitive impairment, which was restored after recovery. We found an association between hemoglobin and cognitive function tests score in the studied groups. The degree of cognitive impairment was associated with the severity of CKD, and dialysis improved cognitive performance."
470,Epidemiology and Public Health Concerns of CKD in Older Adults.,"CKD is increasingly common in older adults. Estimating the glomerular filtration rate can be challenging in this population, with sarcopenia affecting the accuracy of various formulae. Competing risks of death influence the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease. In managing CKD in this population, one must take into consideration other comorbidities including assessment of geriatric syndromes. More research is still needed to guide medical management in this heterogeneous population."
471,Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis Measures and Clinical Outcomes in CKD.,"Rationale & objective: Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) provides a noninvasive assessment of body composition. BIA measures of cell integrity (phase angle) and hydration (vector length) have been associated with mortality among patients receiving dialysis. Whether these measures are associated with clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown. Study design: Observational study. Settings & participants: We studied 3,751 participants with CKD in the prospective multicenter Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) who had baseline single-frequency BIA performed. Predictors: Predictors included phase angle and vector length, which were calculated from measurements of resistance and reactance from BIA. We ranked phase angle and vector length into quartiles and compared the 2 narrower quartiles of phase angle and shorter quartiles of vector length with the 2 upper quartiles. Outcomes: Mortality, heart failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and progression of CKD (30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate or end-stage kidney disease). Analytic approach: We tested associations of phase angle and vector length with risks for mortality and progression of CKD using Cox proportional hazard models and the association with heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease using Fine and Gray models. All models were adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, and kidney function. Results: Mean phase angle and vector length were 6.6°±1.8° and 470 ± 96 Ω/m, respectively. Relative to phase angle ≥ 6.40o, narrower phase angle (<5.59o) was significantly associated with mortality (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.58). Relative to vector length ≥ 459 Ω/m, shorter vector length (<401 Ω/m) was significantly associated with heart failure (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.01-1.61). Neither measure was associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or a composite renal end point. Limitations: Observational study. Conclusions: Adjusted for key confounders, BIA-derived measures of cellular integrity and tissue hydration were significantly associated with death and incident heart failure, respectively."
472,Sevelamer revisited: pleiotropic effects on endothelial and cardiovascular risk factors in chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.,"Endothelial dysfunction underlies multiple cardiovascular consequences of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and antecedent diabetes or hypertension. Endothelial insults in CKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients include uremic toxins, serum uric acid, hyperphosphatemia, reactive oxygen species, and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Sevelamer carbonate, a calcium-free intestinally nonabsorbed polymer, is approved for hyperphosphatemic dialysis patients in the US and hyperphosphatemic stage 3-5 CKD patients in many other countries. Sevelamer has been observed investigationally to reduce absorption of AGEs, bacterial toxins, and bile acids, suggesting that it may reduce inflammatory, oxidative, and atherogenic stimuli in addition to its on-label action of lowering serum phosphate. Some studies also suggest that noncalcium binders may contribute less to vascular calcification than calcium-based binders. Exploratory sevelamer carbonate use in patients with stages 2-4 diabetic CKD significantly reduced HbA1c, AGEs, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23, and total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol versus calcium carbonate; inflammatory markers decreased and defenses against AGEs increased. Sevelamer has also been observed to reduce circulating FGF-23, potentially reducing risk of left ventricular hypertrophy. Sevelamer but not calcium-based binders in exploratory studies increases flow-mediated vasodilation, a marker of improved endothelial function, in patients with CKD. In contrast, lanthanum carbonate and calcium carbonate effects on FMV did not differ in hemodialysis recipients. The recent independent-CKD randomized trial compared sevelamer versus calcium carbonate in predialysis CKD patients (investigational in the US, on-label in European participants); sevelamer reduced 36-month mortality and the composite endpoint of mortality or dialysis inception. Similarly, independent-HD in incident dialysis patients showed improved survival with 24 months of sevelamer versus calcium-based binders. This review discusses recent exploratory evidence for pleiotropic effects of sevelamer on endothelial function in CKD or ESRD. Endothelial effects of sevelamer may contribute mechanistically to the improved survival observed in some studies of CKD and ESRD patients."
